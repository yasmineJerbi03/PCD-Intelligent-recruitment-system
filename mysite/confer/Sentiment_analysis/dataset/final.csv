1;Hard work is the most important key to success
1;success and working so hard it's such perfect thing
1;Without being willing to work hard and put everything into a venture, business success is nearly impossible
1;No matter what industry you work in, hard work and team spirit is the recipe for a burgeoning and successful business
1; as every business owner, manager and entrepreneur will tell you, some days are significantly more productive than others.

1;No matter how hard you work, someone else is working harder
1;technologies are my favourite
0;i'm bad in that
1;Hard work beats talent if talent doesn’t work hard
1;Satisfaction lies in the effort, not in the attainment
1;We think, mistakenly, that success is the result of the amount of time we put in at work, instead of the quality of time we put in
1;Work hard, have fun, make history.
1;The only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary.

1;Without labor, nothing prospers
0;At home alone with not much to do
1;There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure.
1;Great teamwork is the only way we create the breakthroughs that define our careers.
1;Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct individual accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results
1;The price of success is hard work, dedication to the job at hand, and the determination that whether we win or lose, we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at hand.
1;The best teamwork comes from men who are working independently toward one goal in unison
1;In the end, all business operation can be reduced to three words: people, products, and profits. Unless you’ve got a good team, you can’t do much with the other two
1;Nothing is particularly hard if you divide it into small jobs.
1;If you love your work, you’ll be out there every day trying to do it the best you possibly can, and pretty soon everybody around will catch the passion from you – like a fever
1;The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don’t play together, the club won’t be worth a dimemonths. Never wash my cats at home again,
1;I know the price of success: dedication, hard work and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen.
1;Doing the best at this moment puts you in the best place for the next moment.
1;"What is success? I think it is a mixture of having a flair for the thing that you are doing; knowing that it is not enough, that you have got to have hard work and a certain sense of purpose"
1;I have learned that success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has had to overcome while trying to succeed
1;I think that my biggest attribute to any success that I have had is hard work. There really is no substitute for working hard.
1;If you are willing to work hard and ask lots of questions, you can learn business pretty fast

0;One of the most common responses to criticism of any kind is to become defensive, to want to push back and explain that you (in your opinion) have done nothing wrong
0; This is quite a natural response as our brains are wired to react to negative feedback as a kind of threat, so we naturally want to spring to our own defence.
0;.pleasant experience to receive a negative review from a customer.
0;Holly is a very good with punctuality, but her staff is not. She needs to better manage the team to company-required schedules.
0;Frankly, Peter has a ghastly view of on-time attendance. I do not remember a day when he has shown up on time, ready to work.
0;Bill’s shoddy attendance record must improve in the next 90 days or he will be terminated under the company’s attendance policy.
0;Ben is such a quality worker, but unfortunately his punctuality is abysmal. This one area is dragging down Ben’s review and must be improved.
0;Jennifer often runs behind schedule throughout a typical work day causing meetings to start late which affects others’ schedules. She needs to get her schedule in order to help her coworkers.
0;Ryan is often tardy for work and despite repeated warnings, does not respect the attendance policy.
0;For most of the year, Jim has had excellent attendance. Over the last several months, he is frequently absent or late for work. Jim should improve his reliability.
0;For the most part, Paul has been good with his schedule. However, during the summer months, Paul frequently leaves early or takes a half day of unscheduled time off on Friday. This provides a bad impression for his coworkers and employees.For all of us.
1;Bill is quick to congratulate coworkers and builds an atmosphere of trust with his team.
1;Ken’s attitude is an asset to his management skills. He continually builds people up, deals with difficult situations with incredible posture, and focuses on the positives.
1;With the incredible pressure we have been feeling as a company, it would be easy for Tim to get down, but he stands firm that the situation won’t affect his attitude. Tim has a mind-set that few people do and we appreciate that about him.

1;Bill has a cheerful attitude which makes others feel good when he’s around.
1;Julia accentuates the positive in most situations.

0;Bill has a dreadful outlook at times which has a tendency to bring down the entire team.

0;Bill has a tendency to instigate problems between his coworkers.
0;Tom knows that certain conversations provoke members of his team, yet he continues to be vocal about non-work related topics. Tom should keep his conversations work related.
0;Angela has a tendency to erupt over minor things. This causes unease with her coworkers who do not want to set her off.
0;"Terry is quick to show his discontent with work; he should stop to think about how his display affects those around him."
0;Lindsay is a good person, but any constructive criticism devastates her. We cannot walk on egg shells around her if we want the team to get better.
0;Simply put: Jim’s negative attitude negatively affects his work performance. Jim needs to bring his attitude under control.

1;Kyle is an adept communicator and is one of the best business writers I have had the pleasure of working with. Kyle communicates very well through his reports and white papers

1;Allison is excellent at keeping written information about her assignments and projects
1;One of Jim’s strengths is his use of candor and effective communication with his employees.

0;Over the past year, Terry has not performed very well in creating an honest and open environment for the employees he supervises.
0;Jenny must improve her foreign language skills to stay competitive in this industry
0;Greg is not adept at documenting verbal communication. Over the next 90 days, Greg should work on this skill.
0;One of Todd’s roles is to find consensus among his team members, but he has frequently failed to accomplish this task.

0;Jim does not encourage a team-centered work environment.
0;Ben fails to commit his team to cooperating with organizational goals.
0;Harry demonstrates a desire to avoid working with others.
0;Kyle refuses to share crucial information with co-workers for fear he will be marginalized.
0;Manny is very good at individual tasks, but he falls short in cooperating on group projects and in partnership with staff members.
0;John takes on new tasks with ease, but when it comes time to communicate with other team members and train them on these tasks, John does not perform very well.
0;Janet consistently fails to be an effective team member. She needs to improve over the next several months in her teamwork skills
0;Jennifer is too cautious – she is afraid of confrontation so she does not step out to assist when it’s necessary.
0;George gets upset when co-workers do not help him, yet he does not offer assistance to others.
0;Greg is far too focused on finding new ways to accomplish things rather than cooperate with others in a process which is already well tested and defined.
0;Instead of making do with what she has, Holly tends to complain about a lack of resources and personnel.
1;Yolanda constantly searches for new ideas and ways to improve efficiency.
1;Walter creates an exciting atmosphere for his team: one in which new ideas are rewarded and encouraged.
1;"Peter doesn’t accept “we’ve always done it this way” as a solution; instead, he constantly reviews solutions to see if they are the most effective way of doing things."
1;Harry encourages his teammates to think outside of the box and to be more creative with solutions.
1;In meetings, Paul is very good at extracting unique ideas out of people – some you might not consider as very creative people.
1;Fred is a very creative innovator. Specifically, he solved an on-going problem by looking for a solution from all angles.
1;When we’re in crisis mode, we know we can turn to Jenny to craft a viable and inventive solution.
1;Emily has a creative personality which allows her to suggest original ideas. She should continue to adapt this to her position in the company.
1;Tom is an innovator at heart – his skill at inspiring new ideas is an asset to our team.
1;Jim has an imaginative personality and is very resourceful in times of need.
1;Sally has a creative touch in a sometimes monotonous role within our team – the way she adds inspiration to the day to day tasks she performs is admirable.
1;Bill adds an artistic flair to everything he produces which makes his projects much more fun than most.
0;Rachel discourages creative solutions from her team.
0;Kevin has a difficult time thinking “outside of the box” and creating new and untested solutions.
0;Jim is a creative guy but he has a tendency to act before thinking. This causes problems when an untested or unexamined idea is moved forward too quickly.
0;There is a place and time for realism, yet Wendy consistently strikes a practical, hard-nosed look at things without thinking how she could creatively solve a problem.
0;Frank has shown a tendency to be a matter-of-fact manager, but in his position, thinking in a more resourceful manner would do him well.
0;Whenever Bob runs into an obstacle, he has a tendency to stop and ask for help. We encourage him to develop solutions – or even recommendations – before constantly asking for help. 
0;Terry does not research solutions deeply enough and often just compiles ideas found on Web sites. This does not help for many of the problems we run into.
0;Henry rarely innovates and when he does, it seems forced.
0;Trent fails to generate new ideas.
0;Scary lightning and thunder  I'm glad it's over now. Going to sleep, I hope I'm not late to school tomorow again. Haha
0;Jennifer seems unwilling to consider new or intriguing ideas, even when the team runs out of your run-of-the-mill ideas.

0;Tim isn’t willing to take risks on creative ideas.geography, only did like 1 day of study for 1/2 a year of work!
1;Wendy handles customer service situations well and is rated well by her peers, managers, and customers.
1;Nancy is one of our most proficient customer service trainers and demonstrates this when she’s working in customer care.
1;Thomas understands how to listen to customers and extract those details which make a big difference when dealing with our clients
1;Tom is adept at having happy customers and successfully upselling them at the same time.
1;Teri deals with customer complaints with a calm demeanor. Teri is very good at handling difficult situations with customers.

1;Bill takes great pride in his work.
1;Jim has consistently high marks on his customer satisfaction surveys.
1;Paula understands the latitude to ensure customer satisfaction and does everything necessary to retain customers.
1;Lenny is able to handle his clients well and does not have any complaints against him.
0;Frank does not understand how to deal with a difficult customer and too frequently passes the customer on to his supervisor.
0;John’s average time per call is too high and needs to be reduced this year. He needs to learn how to handle customers in a more efficient manner.
0;Ryan is very good at dealing with customers on the phone, but when they come in the store, he doesn’t handle one on one contact very well.
0;In most areas of customer service Harry does a good job, but when it comes to Bill follows the phone scripting in a rigid and inflexible way. In today’s market, we need some creativity and flexibility in dealing with customers, yet Bill does not seem to understand that
0;Jenny does not understand how to overcome client objections and instead gives up to early.
0;Teri can handle the run of the mill customer service situation, but the more complex issues seem to cause her to freeze and not react.
0;ALO is so sad and quiet and empty tonight
0;it's not horrible, if others were singing with I'm sure it could work. I wish I could afford my own drum set
0;John fails to follow up with customers as requested.

1;Jim is a very reliable employee.
1;We depend on Greg to turn in good performance each day and he never fails to impress
1;Ben faithfully commits to get the job done and consistently performs at or above expectations.
1;When we think of “steadfast,” April comes to mind. She is a loyal and trustworthy employee.
1;When we have a situation that must get done, we turn to Harry. Harry has our trust because he’s proven to us he can get the job done.
1;George is known for his dependability and willingness to do what it takes.
0;I dont feel good AT ALL. fuckkk
1;Jennifer is willing to get her hands dirty with her employees to ensure the job gets completed on time.
0;Bob is a very loyal guy, but not a very dependable one. “Flaky” is probably the closest word that comes to mind when thinking of Bob.
1;There are many times we have tasks that absolutely must be completed by a given time. In these circumstances, we know we can turn to Peter to get the task accomplished on time.
0;Holly is usually very steady in her work, but there have been several instances where she has been unreliable.
0;Unfortunately, Ryan does not ever put in overtime even if the job requires it. He is unwilling to work beyond his normally scheduled 40 hours.
0;In this economy, we need people who are willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done. Julia is not one of those people.
0;Peter’s reliability is questionable. Too often, his work results are inconsistent and need to be checked too frequently.
0;While most of his coworkers are willing to work late to get the project finished, Kyle seems content with leaving the work for others to do.
0;Kenny does not demonstrate a concern for what we think of him and whether or not we believe he is up to the job.
0;Lenny is not a dependable employee. If we know a task must be completed, we usually pass him over and find someone else to do the task.
0;Ida does not produce as consistent results as her coworkers do.
0;Peter is not reliable for his effort and does not demonstrate a willingness to do whatever it takes to get the job accomplished.
0;Even if we are behind on production, Holly does not show a willingness to help her employees out. Once promoted to supervisor, she has taken a hands off approach to the detriment of her team
1;Sally has a knack for making people feel important when she speaks with them. This translates into great opportunities for teamwork and connections to form

1;Tim is a positive influence to those around him and inspires them to work harder.

0;Peter needs to continue to improve his technical knowledge through training and self study.
0;Bill needs to improve his technical understanding of his job.
0;Jennifer is not a technician, yet some basic technical knowledge is required of her role. Jennifer needs to work on her technical knowledge.
0;Rote memorization of technical manuals is not the same as technical mastery. Bill needs to work on being able to think outside of the box, beyond the manuals, and troubleshoot technical issues which are not documented.
0;Paul is not technical enough for his role.
0;Terry surprised us by not being more technical in nature considering his background.
0;Technical concepts sometime seem to pass right by Walter. Walter should learn the technical concepts required for his position.

0;It has been difficult for me to work with certain personalities.
0;I have found it difficult to work with aggressive personality types
1; I understand diversity in personalities makes a business strong, I tend to quiet my own ideas and opinions around louder colleagues.

0;It can be difficult for me to maintain a healthy work/life balance.
1;I have an experience in group work

1;. Taking small actions like putting my phone on silent during dinnertime is helpful. When I maintain a good work/life balance, I have found my output is more qualitative, I can get more work done and I feel excited about coming to work in the morning.”
0;I have been uncomfortable working with ambiguity.
0;In my last position as a marketing intern, I found that my supervisor gave very specific instructions regarding my responsibilities. Because I became familiar with having a strong direction, I tend to be unsure when approaching an ambiguous assignment or goal.
1;to do so, I have created a personal framework for times when I feel overwhelmed or confused by an ambiguous task including conducting structured research and asking subject matter experts for advice. 
1; Doing so has helped me thrive when working on ambiguous tasks or when working towards less specific or defined goals.”
1;Motivation is seeing the organization grow which ultimately leads to personal achievement and success
1;It doesn’t matter whether it is a colleague, friend or relative. There are times when the people around your need that extra drive to get going.
1;Working in a team and leading one, is my motivation to do a good job
1;United we stand, divided we fall has been my mantra for success right along. Working in a team has taught me so much more
1; As a leader, it is imperative that you trust your team members and support them. It is also important to create synergy from their individual capabilities.”
1;Convincing people to buy products and services is my source of motivation. I had been in a sales job earlier. The best part of it was interacting with potential buyers. Selling is not an easy task and that is what made it lucrative for me. To work on a product, study about it and then to influence people to try it out is a challenge. I enjoy working under these circumstances
1;I gather motivation by knowing that people believe in me and rely on my judgment of the product
1;Learning newer things is what gives me immense motivation. I remember the time when I heard my friend playing guitar. I was highly impressed by it. So, I took his guitar, started watching guitar videos and picked up the instrument within 3 months of continuous practice
1;There was another instance when I learned how to cook. I did this by scouring various recipes and helping out my mother in the kitchen
1;Beating deadlines is what motivates me to do a good job. This does not mean that I overlook the quality aspect. In my first job, I made it a point to complete most assignments before the stipulated time, with utmost precision. Not only did it impress my boss, but significantly impacted the organization’s profitability.
1;, during my education days, I tried to complete projects well before the deadline. That not only gave me time to re-evaluate them but also help my colleagues with their projects. Completing work before time gives me a sense of pride and achievement
1;. I realize that my seniors can bank upon me when it comes to delivering quality work within a given time. This increases my self-confidence and allows me to push myself harder.”
1;Effort recognition is what motivates me to do a good job. It is very important that for my efforts, I get the deserved mention or applause. This not only keeps me energized but also on my toes to keep working strong. I was a product manager in my previous capacity. The team achieved significant sales growth by my designing a new product
1; I was awarded the best idea distinction for helping them out. That kind of recognition is more satisfying than any kind of monetary compensation.
1;Access to top management is a highly motivating factor. Also, having a non-rigid and accommodative approach is what I like. I have read about organizations keeping an open door policy. It would be a dream for me to work in an organization with such a policy.
1;A flat structure which promotes peer to peer learning and encourages feedback is a big plus for me. If I get to see the CEO/MD for example in the office, it is a big motivation for me.
1;A healthy work culture and a competitive environment is my motivation to do a good job. A good work culture promotes high peer to peer learning, genuine feedback, complaint redressal and suggestion implementation.
1;I derive my energy from people and their behavior around me. Hence, having people from whom I can learn and enhance my knowledge is apt for me. Also, promoting healthy rivalry within peers is something I look forward to. It encourages me to give that extra effort and gain recognition within the organization. It also tends to increases overall work efficiency. An organization which also cares about your personal well being is another big motivation
1;If my boss realizes the importance of being healthy and staying fit, he/she would encourage me to do the same. Hence an environment which looks at my holistic development and not only work-related is my fruit of motivation
1;“Having a good mentor or boss is what motivates me to do a good job. I would enjoy working with someone whom I can look up to. Someone who sets an example for all others will be my criteria of a boss or mentor. If I have a mentor, I would expect guidance beyond work. Non-work related issues can hamper work at times. It is a good mentor who can see through these things.
1;Having a person above you who is willing to sit and discuss things is highly motivating. Gaining work-related knowledge is also important. A mentor can teach you tricks of the trade which would go a long way to enhance your career. I would hence like to work with someone who has command over his /her area of work. There can be instances when I do something wrong. Situations where I am stuck up. I would then want someone who will reprimand and guide me. A great boss or mentor would be the prime reason why I would stick to a particular work profile.

1;I am an ambitious and driven individual. I thrive in a goal-oriented environment where I can constantly challenge myself personally and professionally. I am always looking for an opportunity to do better and grow. These characteristics have helped me achieve success in my career. For example, I was promoted three times in less than two years in my last position
1;What makes me unique is my ability to meet and exceed deadlines. In my previous role, my manager consistently praised me for completing my projects efficiently with a high level of quality. This allowed me to take on additional responsibilities and eventually led to a promotion
1;The company’s mission to help college grads pay off their student loan debt resonates with me. I’ve been in student loan debt myself and would love the opportunity to work with a company that’s making a difference. Finding a company with a positive work environment and values that align with my own has remained a priority throughout my job search and this company ranks at the top of the list
1;While I highly valued my time at my previous company, there are no longer opportunities for growth that align with my career goals. This position fits perfectly with my skill set and how I’m looking to grow in my career. I’m also looking for a position at a company like yours that supports underserved communities, which is a personal passion of mine.”
1;Making a true difference in the lives of my patients and their families motivates me to strive for excellence in everything I do. I look forward to seeing my patient’s reactions when we get a positive outcome that will change their lives forever. That’s why I became a nurse and why I’m pursuing a position in pediatrics.
1;.One of the things I loved about my last job was witnessing the results of my team’s code update and watching as our months of work yielded positive user feedback
1;Having the opportunity to lead projects from ideation through launch was one of the reasons I was so excited to apply for this role
1;"""I’ve been refining my project management skills with volunteer opportunities and side projects with other teams, and I received my PMP last quarter."
1;I’m looking for an opportunity where I can put those abilities to work for a mission I’m passionate about
1;.I was also excited to read in the job description that this role will require regular presentations to key stakeholders—one of my key motivators is the ability to connect with colleagues and communicate my team’s work, so this is an especially exciting part of this opportunity
1;Ultimately, I’ve learned a lot in my current role, but I’m looking for the next step where I can continue to grow and use the skills I’ve honed to contribute to a company I love, and this opportunity seems to be the perfect fit
1;I’ve always been a natural leader
1;.I’ve exceeded my KPIs every quarter and have been promoted twice in the past five years. I look back at those successes and know that I wouldn’t have reached them if I hadn’t built and led teams composed of highly skilled and diverse individuals. I’m proud of my ability to get cross-functional groups on the same page
1;I’ve also regularly honed my management skills through 360 reviews and candid sessions with my team, and I know continuing to build my leadership skills is something I want from my next role
0;From high school and into my early professional interactions, it sometimes prevented me from speaking up
1;.I joined an improv acting class. It’s fun and has really helped me overcome my shyness. I learned practical skills around leading discussions and sharing diverse perspectives. Now, in group settings, I always start conversations with the quieter folks. I know exactly how they feel, and people can be amazing once they start talking
1;I would like to continue developing my marketing expertise over the next several years. One of the reasons I’m interested in working for a fast-growing startup company is that I’ll have the ability to wear many hats and collaborate with many different departments. I believe this experience will serve me well in achieving my ultimate goal of someday leading a marketing department
1;In five years, I’d like to be an industry expert in my field, able to train and mentor students and entry-level designers alike. I would also like to gain specialized expertise in user experience to be a well-rounded contributor working with design and marketing teams on large-scale projects that make a difference both in the company and the global community.
1;Some of my future goals for the next few years include leading a design team in a formal capacity. I’m also excited about the prospect of working with product and event teams on developing streamlined processes—this is a natural fit with my project management background. I’d also like to further develop my skills in user experience to aid in creating more user-focused designs all around.
1;It was the first day of my boss’s two-week vacation and our agency’s highest-paying client threatened to leave because he didn’t feel he was getting the personalized service he was promised. I spent my lunch hour on the phone with him talking through his concerns. We even brainstormed ideas for his next campaign. He was so grateful for the personal attention that he signed another six-month contract before my boss even returned from her trip.
1;My experience accurately managing inventory intake and skills in creating effective, streamlined schedules make me uniquely qualified to succeed in this kitchen manager position. I understand that you require a highly organized candidate with acute attention to detail. In my previous job, I successfully handled schedules for 20 employees and reduced food waste by 15%. I’m confident in my ability to use my organizational skills to bring efficiency and order to your restaurant
1;It was a great entry-level position at a start-up agency. Not only was I learning more about marketing, but management was also very transparent, teaching us a great deal about owning a business. It was a very collaborative atmosphere, and the team and I worked together on almost every project. Everyone's weak point was countered by another's strong point. I learned more working there than I ever did in college, and I'm excited to apply these skills to a new position
1;While I enjoyed my time learning and growing in my last job, there was a lack of opportunity in the way I wanted to progress in my career. I deeply enjoy being challenged and getting better at what I do, which I understand is a top priority for managers at your organization. That’s why I’m excited to continue having conversations about this opportunity.
1;I’m able to stay calm when I focus on the bigger picture and break down my projects into smaller tasks. I always start by asking myself, “What is the ultimate goal I’m trying to achieve?” From there, I make a list of immediate and long-term action items with achievable but ambitious deadlines. Even if the big project is due tomorrow, I ask myself, ‘What’s something I can tackle in the next 30 minutes?’ Before I know it, I’ve made significant progress and that impossible project doesn’t seem so impossible.
1;In my last role, I managed all social media content. I noticed other brands were experimenting with videos and seeing great engagement from their customers, so I asked my boss if we could do a low-budget test. She agreed, so I produced a video cheaply in-house that drove double the engagement we normally saw on our social channels. It also drove conversions with 30% of viewers visiting our website within a week of seeing the video
1;“When it comes to managing people, my teaching philosophy is to start by asking questions that hopefully get the person to come to a new conclusion on their own. This way, they feel ownership over the learning rather than feeling micromanaged
1;In my experience, good customer service involves taking responsibility when something goes wrong and doing what you can to make it right. For example, on a recent flight, I had pre-ordered my meal only to discover they didn’t stock enough of my dish. Instead of simply stating the facts, the flight attendant apologized sincerely and offered me a free drink or premium snack. To me, this apology went a long way in smoothing things over. The freebie was a bonus that made me feel valued as a customer and choose the same airline for my next flight
1;I define success as fulfilling my role in my team and in the company. I work toward completing my individual duties as effectively as possible, balancing that with professional growth and contributing to larger organizational goals. In my previous role, success meant exceeding weekly metrics, implementing processes that supported the company’s KPIs and meeting quarterly professional development goals.
1;Throughout my career, I’ve discovered how to embrace working under pressure. I find that routine can make us complacent, so I try to look for challenges that push me to grow.
1;, I was supposed to deliver a project to a client in five days. A colleague who was working with another client had the same deadline, but he had to take a leave of absence due to personal reasons. I was forced to take up both projects at the same time. While I felt an initial sense of panic, I tried to reframe it as an opportunity to see what I might be capable of. Instead of letting the stress get to me, I came up with a very detailed time management plan and found new ways to boost my efficiency that enabled me to deliver both projects on time.
1;I enjoy guiding other team members on projects and making sure everything goes smoothly
1;My dream job would be a leadership position where the other team members are active participants and communication happens daily.
1;I love seeing a project through to the end and celebrating everyone’s hard work
1;For instance, if you’re applying for a leadership position, you might discuss how your dream job would include supervisory responsibilities
1;My problem-solving abilities allow me to work extremely well under pressure, which I understand is a common occurrence in this role. In a previous position as the purchasing lead, I had to decide which supplies to order to stay within the budget, but I had a limited amount of time to make a decision. I quickly created a spreadsheet that helped me compare manufacturers’ prices and was able to order the necessary supplies on time and within our budget.
1;I was working as a project manager on an IT project, and one technician was constantly late finishing tasks. When I approached him about it, he reacted defensively. I kept calm and acknowledged that the deadlines were challenging and asked how I could assist him in improving his performance.
1;He calmed down and told me that he was involved in another project where he had to do tasks that were not in his job description. After a meeting with the other project manager, we came to a resolution that alleviated the technician’s workload. For the remainder of the project, the technician delivered great work.
1;I learned that you don’t always know what others are experiencing and by keeping that in mind, I can better navigate conflict and be a more helpful and supportive colleague.”
1;While I highly valued my time at my previous company, there are no longer opportunities for growth that align with my career goals. This position fits perfectly with my skill set and how I’m looking to grow in my career. I’m also looking for a position at a company like yours that supports underserved communities, which is a personal passion of mine
1;“I can make anyone feel comfortable in a new environment, which makes me a good fit as a human resources assistant. In my previous position, a new employee came to me and told me that she didn’t think she was right for the company culture. After talking to her for a few minutes, we realized that she felt too much pressure to participate in company events. I started introducing events that involved fewer competitions and more casual environments, and she quickly grew more comfortable with her team.
1;As a cybersecurity specialist, my greatest strength is my intellectual curiosity. I enjoy researching the latest technology trends so that our critical information technology systems remain uncompromised.
1;As an ER nurse, I find that the best way for me to de-stress when I’m not working is to relax outdoors, rain or shine. I’ve always been an avid hiker, nature photographer, and trout fisher, and one of my favorite things to do is to volunteer with the U.S. Forest Service and with local salmon habitat restoration groups.
1;I also lead group hikes on some of Mt. Baker’s more challenging trails. This is where the skills I developed during my initial training as a military nurse sometimes come in handy. My current personal goal is to climb Mt. Rainier next summer. Being outdoors never fails to renew my spirit so that I’m able to be the best ER nurse I can be.  
1;Construction design is in my blood—both my dad and my grandad were home builders who owned their own construction firm. From the time I entered college, I knew that I wanted my architecture career to be focused on sustainable, green design practices, so I earned my certification as a LEED Accredited Professional.
1;Greenways Construction is the most respected sustainable design firm in Texas. I’ve been following reports of your LEED Certified projects in the Journal of Green Engineering, and I wrote my capstone project on the energy modeling you pioneered for the ACME Business Park and the ABC Tech campus. Working here really would be my dream job, since your mission aligns perfectly with my goals as a sustainability specialist.
1;You should hire me because my experience is almost perfectly aligned with the requirements you asked for in your job listing. I have seven years’ progressive experience in the hospitality industry, advancing from my initial role as a front desk associate with Excalibur Resort and Spa to my current position there as a concierge.
1; I’m well-versed in providing world-class customer service to an upscale clientele, and I pride myself on my ability to quickly resolve problems so that our guests enjoy their time with us. 
1;Not only do I do this by reading the latest issues of cybersecurity journals, but I also convinced my employer to fund my participation in quarterly information technology conferences. This has allowed me to build a network of peer resources—many of whom are leaders in the field—that I can call upon for strategies when new threats arise to our systems. 
0;My greatest weakness used to be procrastination. Friends who knew my work style would tease me, saying, “Panic precipitates performance.” In college, I was the person who pulled all-nighters to finish their essay right before the deadline.
0;This isn’t as irresponsible as it sounds—from the moment I’m assigned a project, I’m thinking about it. Most of my first and second drafts get composed mentally, so it’s only a matter of writing down the final draft. And, since I have an excellent command of grammar, I don’t have to spend much time proofreading or revising
0;However, after I landed my first job as a content writer, it became clear that while this process worked for me (I’ve never missed a deadline), it made my editor extremely nervous. So, I’ve learned to set “early” deadlines for myself, at least 24 hours before the actual deadline, so that my projects now always arrive with plenty of time to spare. 
1;I was very fortunate to be hired by ABC Company right out of college. They taught me a lot about digital marketing, and it’s been stimulating to work as a contributor to their creative teams. However, I’m ready for the next step.
1;I’ve always been a leader—I was captain of the crew team in college, student body vice president, and I’ve served as team lead for most of our projects in FY 2020. I think I’m ready to move into management, but ABC Company already has very talented managers in place, and they won’t be leaving such a great employer anytime soon. I’ve completed supplemental management training courses during my time there, and I know I can hit the ground running as your next digital marketing manager. 
1;I’m not someone who is energized by or thrives in stressful environments. My first step in managing stress is to try to circumvent it by keeping my work processes very organized, and my attitude professional.
1;When customers or associates come to me with issues, I try to look at things from their perspective, and initiate a collaborative problem-solving approach to keep the situation from escalating. I find that maintaining an efficient, congenial office with open lines of communication automatically reduces a lot of workplace stress.
1;Of course, sometimes unanticipated stressors will arise. When this happens, I just take a deep breath, remembering that the person I’m dealing with is frustrated with a situation, not with me. I then actively listen to their concerns and make a plan to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.  
0;I think the most difficult situation I face as a production manager is when I have to lay off staff, either because they aren’t doing their job properly or, even worse, because sales are down.
1;When I can, I try to work with underperforming personnel to see if we can’t improve their efficiency. If not, then I hand them their pink slip and give them straightforward reasons for why they are being laid off. No one wants to be fired without an explanation.
1;I’m someone who likes stability. My goal is to find a job that I can hold long term with a local company, becoming a valued employee as I gradually advance to positions of increasing authority and responsibility.
1;I’m extremely interested in the teller job here at First Financial Credit Union because of your internal training program. My long-term goal is to eventually become a branch manager after I’ve proven my competencies in customer service and team leadership.
1;When I’m not working, I like to spend time exploring with my dogs. I take them hiking, visiting historical sites, or even just walking around town. A surprising number of people are drawn to dogs, and I always enjoy talking with who I meet. I feel that communication is one of the most important aspects of my professional life as well. When talking with people, being able to guide the conversation in a particular direction is one of the ways I’ve been successful in different situations at the office.
1;I participate in charity walks several times a year. Recently, I did the Walk for Hunger and I have a few events planned for the summer and fall, as well. I walk for exercise with friends after work and on the weekends. I enjoy the fresh air, learning new routes, and connecting with new people. I also like the fundraising aspect, which has come in handy in my job. I’ve learned how to connect with people to increase their commitment to the cause.
1;The past few years, I’ve gotten really into geocaching. I love the challenge of finding caches and spending time outdoors with friends. I like using my problem-solving skills to find the ones that are really well-hidden. Learning how people hide things—and where people are likely to look—has helped me tremendously in my design work. It’s all about learning to see things through someone else’s eyes.
1;I have a solid work ethic. When I'm working on a project, I don't just want to meet deadlines. Rather, I prefer to complete the project well ahead of schedule. Last year, I even earned a bonus for completing my three most recent reports one week ahead of time.
1;I have extremely strong writing skills. Having worked as a copyeditor for five years, I have a deep attention to detail when it comes to my writing. I have also written for a variety of publications, so I know how to shape my writing style to fit the task and audience. As a marketing assistant, I will be able to write and edit press releases effectively and to update web content with accuracy and ease.
1;I am a skilled sales representative with over ten years' experience. I have exceeded my sales goals every quarter by at least 20%, and I've earned a bonus each year since I started with my current employer.
1;I pride myself on my customer service skills and my ability to resolve potentially difficult situations. With five years' experience as a customer service associate, I have learned to understand and resolve customer issues effectively. On a related note, I also have strong communication skills, which help me to work well with customers, team members, and executives. I am known for being an effective team member with a talent for giving presentations.
1;My background as an English major will certainly help me succeed in the job. I restructured, edited, and wrote the employee newsletter for the hospital and in particular showcased employee profiles and contributions. Our surveys indicated that the new format was more appreciated and more widely read by staff, and helped to build morale. I also rewrote major sections of the employee handbook to simplify the language.
0;I am probably the most gifted applicant you will ever meet. Everyone says that I am extremely intelligent, hard-working, and a fabulous communicator.
1;Numbers have not always been my strong suit. Fortunately, as a copywriter, I can focus most of my time on the creative process of writing. However, in recent years I have begun to familiarize myself with the digital analytics tools used in the various websites and apps I write for, and I have found that when you add context, “numbers” can actually be quite enlightening.
1;One area I improved on in the past is my salesmanship skills. As a product manager who works with internal teams and does not interface with clients or sales prospects, I don’t do much, if any, selling in my role. However, since I do communicate quite frequently with the sales team, I felt it might benefit me to have a greater understanding of their strategies and tactics
1;"I took a sales skills course online. It improved how I work with sales teams, and now, when I join sales meetings, I have a much better idea of what’s going on, and I feel more effective in communicating with the sales team. This course also helped me build upon the skills I use to ""sell"" my vision for the product internally."
1;I have a very strong attention to detail. Sometimes, this can turn into a tendency to perfectionism. In the past, I found this leading me to triple-check every item on a spreadsheet, closely proofread emails to ensure I’d communicated what I was trying to get across in a clear, concise way, or fiddle with the layout of a presentation to ensure that it was perfect. I’ve since learned to successfully budget my time and gauge which tasks require and actually benefit from this level of precision.
1; Organization hasn’t always been my strongest point. I’ve always been inclined to prioritize tasks that directly impact the bottom line, and maintaining a pristine desk or an organized inbox didn’t seem to truly move the needle in terms of my output. Over time, I’ve learned that keeping a clean workspace—both physically, and digitally—does support my ability to focus and enhance the efficiency of my workflow. I’ve implemented a time management system that enables me to stay organized without encroaching on my other responsibilities.
1;When I'm working on a project, I don't just want to meet deadlines. Rather, I prefer to complete the project well ahead of its due date. While this means I never miss a deadline, it also means that sometimes I can find myself rushed when I’m working. I’ve since learned to slow down, be more patient, and give each project the careful attention it deserves.
1;I used to wait until the last minute to set appointments for the coming week, but I realized that scheduling in advance makes much more sense. I’m now much more proactive about scheduling meetings, and this allows me to plan and segment out my work for the week without having to guess at when I’ll need to leave time for meetings.
1;Sometimes I spend more time than necessary on a task or take on tasks that could easily be delegated to someone else. Although I've never missed a deadline, it is still an effort for me to know when to move on to the next task and to be confident when assigning others work. In my recent position, I implemented a project management tool that allowed me to easily oversee the progress of all the tasks I assigned. This helped me feel much more comfortable about delegating work.
1;I used to like to work on one project to its completion before starting on another, but I've learned to work on many projects at the same time, and I think doing so allows me to be more creative and effective in each one.
0;I do good work
0;I'm the best
0;"""I'm not sure, but I'm a good learner."""
0;"I'm the best one for the job"" or ""I am great with people and a hard worker."""
0;"""I'm a huge fan of the Yankees and avid softball player with the gift of gab; I'm usually the life of the party."""
0;It's hard to say, but I'm a great salesman
0;i don't have any amazing and unbelievable
0;I have so many, it's hard to pick just one
0;I'm not a good speller
0;I'm bad with math and spreadsheets
0;I hate dealing with difficult people
0;I'm not very good with the newer versions of Microsoft Office
0;I need the money.
0;I need a job.
0;I'm unemployed.
1;I have just graduated with honors in Biochemistry. I know my way around a lab and have had multiple opportunities to put my knowledge into practice as a chemistry research assistant
1;I’ve always wanted to get into marketing. Having done promotional jobs here and there, I never had an opportunity to do something more serious.
1; He takes initiative to address concerns with other staff in a timely manner promoting understanding and cooperation
0;One of his roles is to find consensus among his team members, but he has frequently failed to accomplish this task
0;He holds too many meetings. Holding fewer meetings would be more effective
0;He lacks credibility in his messages. His coworkers do not believe he is honest.
0;He does not convey a positive image of the company to customers
1;While I work hard to avoid errors in my work, I am willing to push myself to complete new and challenging tasks that I might be unable to accomplish. For example, I was once working on a team project, when three of our six team members had to leave the group to complete a different assignment. With half of our team gone, we thought the project might fail. However, I led our group in revising our team plan and setting new daily goals. We ended up completing the task on time and received praise from our company CEO for our thorough work. When I am faced with a challenge like this, one that has the potential to fail, I always step up to the plate.
1;I am a creative thinker who is willing to develop and try out new ideas and strategies. Usually these ideas work, but when they fail, that is often when I learn the most.
1;. For instance, as a curriculum developer for a high school, I created a new elective course for freshmen. We performed a trial run of the course, and students did not respond well to the class. Rather than throwing our hands up, we received feedback from the students, reworked the class based on their responses, and ran the class again the next year. That year, the class got great reviews from the students. By trying new ideas out, we learn what doesn’t work, and how to make those things better.
1;Yes, I believe failure is one of the best ways to learn and improve. For example, at my first job at a retail store, our company got a new computer-operated cash register. The first day I used the register, I did not know how to perform certain functions on it. Rather than give up or become overwhelmed, I stayed at work after closing to practice.
1;I was the employee with the most knowledge about the register. I ended up giving a tutorial on using the register to the other clerks, because they were all having the same problems I initially did. By failing and then learning from that failure, I was able to become a leader at my job.
1;I’m an enthusiastic, positive worker, who’s dedicated to completing the tasks but not complaining about the process. Here’s a good example: We had to completely re-do our inventory when I worked at ABC Company. This sounds like a silly thing, but I brought in a big bag of candy, and created a scavenger hunt to accompany the task. By the end, everyone was in good spirits.
1;I’m dedicated to working with my team to discover and implement the most effective approach. At my last job, we needed to reduce spending in one cost center area. I shared the issue with my team and had everyone brainstorm ideas for a follow-up meeting a week later. As it turned out, one of my team members had a great idea that we used to reduce costs by 10%. After we implemented the strategy, I nominated her for a company-wide prize.
1;My work style is extremely flexible—working on so many different projects requires me to be adaptive. In general, I try to work on one project at a time, working as quickly and efficiently as possible to achieve the best results. All of my projects require collaboration, so I use the team environment to check for errors. I am a perfectionist and a driven worker, and I think my clear communication skills allow me to bring out the best in any team, in any project.
1;I am extremely dependable. I have rarely missed a day's work, and am known for coming in early and staying late to finish important tasks and achieve results. This dependability extends to my collaborative work as well. I always meet deadlines and help my teammates to meet theirs as well. For example, on my last project, a teammate was struggling to complete his assignment for the team, and I stayed late every day that week to help him not only complete his assignment, but exceed our initial estimated turnaround time for the project.
1;I always keep on top of my projects. Owing to my organizational skills and efficiency, I can successfully juggle multiple projects at once. While I complete most of my work independently, I greatly value input and will consult with team members to ensure we're all on the same track. I also appreciate checking in regularly with my boss to update her on my progress and ask about any issues that have arisen. This open communication helps me complete tasks efficiently and accurately.
1;Absolutely! As a recent college graduate, I have nothing tying me down here. My ambition is to land a job working for a global company where I can advance my career over the long haul. And if this means moving in order to gain experience, enhance your operations, or secure promotions, bring it on! I love exploring and adapting to new environments and local cultures—there are always new friends to be made and interesting experiences to gain.
1;You should hire me because my experience is almost perfectly aligned with the requirements you asked for in your job listing. I have seven years’ progressive experience in the hospitality industry, advancing from my initial role as a front desk associate with Excalibur Resort and Spa to my current position there as a concierge.
1;I’m well-versed in providing world-class customer service to an upscale clientele, and I pride myself on my ability to quickly resolve problems so that our guests enjoy their time with us. 
1;I'm a people person. I really enjoy meeting and working with a lot of different people, and I am known for being a great listener and clear communicator, whether I’m engaging with colleagues or interacting with clients.
1;I'm the kind of person who knows how to execute difficult tasks with precision. I pay attention to all the details of a project. I make sure that every task is just right and that it is completed in a timely manner.
1;I'm a creative thinker. I like to explore alternative solutions to problems, and I have an open mind about what will work best. My creativity has made me an effective team leader because I can anticipate problems and innovate solutions.
1;I'm an extremely organized person who is focused on producing results. While I am always realistic when setting goals, I consistently develop ways to efficiently achieve, and often exceed, those goals.
1;I enjoy solving problems, troubleshooting issues, and coming up with solutions in a timely manner. I thrive in team settings, and I think my skill in effectively communicating with others is what drives my ability to solve a variety of problems.
1;I'm looking for a way to transfer my writing, media relations, event planning skills, and public relations expertise to a position within healthcare. I'm fascinated by the trends in healthcare and have a family background in medicine. The prospect of working for a hospital is very appealing to me. Ultimately, I have an interest in managing a communications operation at a hospital, but I see that as a few years down the road after I've further honed my skills.
1;I've always loved sales and thrived on the excitement of landing new clients and competing with my peers. Your position is attractive since it would provide the opportunity for me to enhance relationships with current major clients while also pursuing new customers. I want to stay in sales for the foreseeable future. My goal will be to become one of the leading account managers on your staff, recognized as a product expert with a strong track record of satisfying customers.
1;As you can see from my background, I've spent the past three years since graduate school as an HR generalist. During this time, I've enjoyed my work in recruiting. I am looking to specialize in the employment arena with a company such as yours, which has a large recruitment operation.
1;Ultimately, maybe three to five years down the road, I'd love to direct a recruiting operation at a major company, if I could keep my hands in some of the activities I enjoy, such as interviewing candidates.
1;I have always been able to create and maintain an efficient work schedule that allows me to work on the same number of hours per week. Of course, when I am working on a particularly important or difficult project, I am happy to occasionally increase those hours to produce my best work.
1;While I know this job requires me to work a set number of hours every week, I am always willing to come in early or stay late to help complete a task. While I work efficiently, I will go above and beyond when my colleagues need me.
1;I'm committed to working with the team, so I'm willing to pitch in extra hours when my group is under the gun
1;Work-life balance is important to me, so I work extremely hard on weekdays so that I can complete my duties and focus on my family on the weekends. I will certainly come in on occasional weekends whenever needed, but I think my time management skills will make that the exception rather than the rule
1;Whenever I’ve begun any new assignments, I have found that I was able to assimilate very easily by following a simple strategy. I ask questions, listen to the answers, contribute to the conversation, and ask for feedback. This has always provided me with excellent preparation to take on the new position.
1;I have worked within many different organizations all with their own way of doing things. There are many ways to achieve the same goals, and I have learned lots of different strategies for success. I think having that experience makes me very adaptable to new situations.
1;I tend to be a little quiet and spend some time observing at the beginning of a placement so that I can assess the requirements of the position. Then I can quickly determine how to be the most productive in the job I'm doing. Because I tend to be very observant, I am able to quickly assess the structure of the work and the relationships in a new environment. I am good at determining what my role is, and how to be most effective during my post with the company.
1;I came from a very small town in the Midwest, and when I started my first semester at Boston University, it was a little bit of a culture shock. I have always been very people-oriented and curious about the experiences of others. I found that by connecting on a personal level with my dorm mates, I was able to assimilate into the campus culture very quickly.
1;My experiences growing up in a military family prepared me well for assimilating into new environments. We had the opportunity to live not only all over the US, with its wonderful regional mores, but also abroad in some societies quite different from our own. I really enjoy new environments and am confident in my ability to assimilate quickly.
1;Coming to work for a new company certainly involves a lot of adjustments. However, I have always been able to adapt quickly to new work situations. A large part of this has to do with my ability to get along and communicate effectively with many people. For example, when I started my previous job, I introduced myself to my colleagues right away and felt confident asking them questions in my first couple of weeks when I was unsure of something.
1;My ability to be open and friendly to everyone, and to communicate my questions or concerns when I need to, will help me adjust quickly to this new work environment. I also know you value the collaboration on many company projects, so I know my ability to foster relationships and communicate effectively will help me in this regard as well.
1;While I have been at my previous job for ten years, I have had to make a number of adjustments and adapt quickly to many new changes. For example, halfway through my time at Company X, I received a promotion, which required me to do much more work with our content management system.
1;While I had little involvement with IT in the past, I worked extremely hard over the next couple of weeks to master the system. I stayed late a few nights, becoming familiar with the system, and I reached out to our IT department to ask questions. By the end of two weeks, I felt extremely confident, and within a month, I was teaching the system to a new employee. Adjusting to a new job takes time and hard work, but I know from past experiences that I am up to the task.
1;I usually work at a steady, consistent pace. Because of my ability to organize and plan out my work schedule, I always complete my work ahead of time. For example, when I was assigned a large project due in six months, I broke the project into large goals and small, day-to-day goals. I created a schedule, and steadily checked off each of these goals while still successfully completing my other duties. I ultimately finished the project a week ahead of schedule.
1;"I consider myself a diligent worker who avoids procrastination. At my previous sales job, we had to make at least 30 calls every shift, on top of our other administrative responsibilities. While some people saved all their calls for the end of their shift, which sometimes led to people missing their quota, I divided my time between making calls and doing my other duties. I am not easily distracted, but instead can balance working steadily on multiple tasks. This allows me to complete all of my work on time and produce quality results. In fact, I won ""best salesperson"" three times at my previous company."
1;I have been praised for my ability to hand in assignments well ahead of schedule. Although I work quickly, I also produce quality work. For example, I am currently responsible for writing our quarterly newsletter. I tend to complete the assignment at least two or three days before the submission deadline, which gives me time to thoroughly proofread my work. Both employers and colleagues have commented on my error-free newsletters.
1;My colleagues have told me that I am extremely organized and excellent at time management. During one project, my team members praised me for developing and sticking to a timeline for all the phases of the project. (Give a brief summary of what the project was.) We ended up successfully completing it ahead of time, and it was a hit!
1;My colleagues would say that I am very optimistic, as I see setbacks as opportunities to learn and grow. There is always a creative solution to a problem, and I love searching for it. One instance that comes to mind was when colleagues from my last job were upset about budget cuts to our department, and I devised a few clever ways to maintain some of our resources on a shoestring budget. They ended up being implemented.
1;I’ve been told that I am both a strong leader and a team player. In fact, one colleague offered to write me a personal letter of reference at one point because of my strong team leadership. 
1;He was impressed by my ability to effectively lead a group of colleagues while also listening to and considering everyone’s input as we determined the best plan of action for this new company initiative
1;I recently asked my psych professor to write a recommendation, and she mentioned my writing skills, intellectual curiosity, and research abilities as keys to my success in her classes.
1;"My friends always tease me about being the one who will organize all our outings. They think I'm a bit obsessive about nailing down the arrangements; a stickler for details."
1;My sociology professor and academic advisor recently nominated me to be the student representative to the sociology department. They cited my leadership ability and verbal skills as reasons for the nomination.
1;You have done a very thorough job of getting at my strengths. We have discussed my writing, presentation, and computer skills, but I haven't had the opportunity to tell you about my persuasive abilities. For example, I was able to convince seven local businesses to sponsor the charity run which I organized for my fraternity, and I successfully placed several stories in the local media about a client during my public relations internship.
1;I think that you have been incredibly thorough and we have discussed my key strengths like my communication skills, my ability to work across departments, and my experience in public relations. However, one important skill I have not yet mentioned is web design. I recently completed an internship at XYZ Public Relations firm, in which I helped design a new website for one of their clients. The client was extremely happy with my design and even sent a letter to our CEO praising my skills. I am familiar with a number of web design platforms, including Squarespace, Webflow, and Wix. This skill is something I would love to bring to your company.
1;I think we have covered a number of my work experiences that make me a strong candidate for this position, including my ten years of teaching experience, my administrative experience, and my communication skills. I would like to add that I also have experience running afterschool programs for teens. At my previous job, I led two afterschool programs: the school newspaper, which had a staff of twenty-five students, and the literary journal, which had a staff of fifteen. I would also like to assure you that I am very excited about the opportunity here. I am extremely motivated to pursue this job and will devote maximum energy to succeeding if I am hired.
1;We have discussed many of my skills, abilities, and experiences that make me a strong candidate, including my experience working with clients and my written and oral communication skills. I would also like to add that I am currently developing another skill that will make me an even more effective employee, should I be hired. I am currently taking a computer programming course, and am learning SQL and Java at the moment. I am extremely passionate about this job opportunity, and I believe my skills (including the skills I am currently developing) make me a strong candidate.
1;I'm really driven by results. I like it when I have a concrete goal to meet and enough time to figure out a strong strategy for accomplishing it. At my last job, our yearly goals were very aggressive, but I worked with my manager and the rest of my team to figure out a month-by-month strategy for meeting the year-end numbers. It was a real thrill to accomplish that.
1;I'm motivated by digging into data. Give me a spreadsheet and questions, and I'm eager to figure out what's driving the numbers. At my current position, I prepare the monthly analytics report around sales. The data from these reports help drive and determine how the company charts its next steps and makes sales goals for the following months. Being able to provide that essential information is really motivating.
1;I was responsible for several projects where I directed development teams and implemented repeatable processes. The teams achieved 100% on-time delivery of software products. I was motivated both by the challenge of finishing the projects ahead of schedule and by managing the teams that achieved our goals.
1;I have always wanted to ensure that my company's clients get the best customer service I can offer. I feel it's important, both to me personally and for the company and the clients, to provide a positive customer experience. My drive to constantly develop my customer service skills is the reason I earned top sales at my company two quarters in a row.
1;I have always been motivated by the desire to meet a deadline. Setting and reaching deadlines gives me such a sense of accomplishment. I love creating an organized schedule for completing a task and achieving my goals on time. For example, when I ran a fundraising event last year, I set multiple deadlines for a variety of tasks leading up to the event. Achieving each milestone motivated me to keep working and helped me to ensure that the event ran smoothly.
1;Absolutely. I am passionate about this work and am therefore always looking for new and innovative ideas to bring to a project. For example, I was so inspired by the last ad campaign I worked on that I suggested a number of unique ad strategies that my employers loved and ultimately implemented. My passion motivates me to think creatively and produce results.
1;I know that I am self-motivated. I give my all to any project and am always looking ahead to the next task at hand. Successfully completing one project and moving on to the next one is very exciting for me. I am passionate about my work and truly enjoy working toward the next big goal. For example, after successfully completing a team project ahead of our deadline, I immediately sought out and requested to join another team on a project I had been interested in for a while. I am always looking for the next project to pour my passion into.
1;I have always been self-motivated. No one in my family had attended college, but I was always determined to do so. I, therefore, put myself through college and graduate school with no financial support from my family. In the workplace, I bring that same drive to managing projects and deadlines. I know how to set a goal for myself and achieve it.
1;Yes, I am very self-motivated. In school, particularly in my journalism courses, I always put extra effort into projects, simply due to my passion for journalism. For example, one course required us to write an article on a particular topic. I went above and beyond, conducting multiple interviews and going to the local archives to research the topic. I ultimately got this article published in a magazine. I believe this self-motivation and passion for journalism will make me a strong assistant editor for your newspaper.
1;Decisions I have to make within a team are difficult, only because these decisions take more time and require deliberate communication between team members. For example, I was working on a team project, and my colleagues and I had to make a number of choices about how to use our limited budget. Because these decisions involved group conversations, our team learned how to communicate effectively with one another, and I believe we ultimately made the best decisions for the team.
1;As a manager, the most difficult decisions I make involve layoffs. Before making those tough decisions, I always think carefully about what is best for the business and my employees. While I don’t relish making those kinds of choices, I don’t shy away from this part of my job. A few years ago, I had to let some employees go due to the economic climate. It was a hard decision that was ultimately necessary for the good of the company and everyone working for the organization.
1;I find that the hardest decision I have to make is when I have to choose between strong team members for a promotion. There have been occasions when, even though I liked one person better than another, I nonetheless had to choose the other person based on their potential to assume the responsibilities of their new role. Sometimes I also had to promote younger employees over staff with seniority, simply because they were more skilled in the use of technology and more willing to work overtime. It’s never easy, but ultimately you have to think about who will be the most effective and productive in the new position.
1;My biggest disappointment is that I wasn’t able to follow my dream of being a professional dancer. I was injured as a teenager during a performance and was never able to move quite as fluidly again. Even though I was disappointed at the time, I realize now that if I had taken that direction, I would not have achieved my advanced degrees and developed a career that I love.
1;I set a goal to be on the dean's list every semester in college and was very disappointed when I missed the mark during the first semester of my junior year. I was working 25 hours a week and took 21 credits that semester. I reduced my work hours to 15 and took 18 credits the next semester and achieved highest honors.
1;At the time, not being able to go straight to college out of high school was the greatest disappointment. However, the two years I spent working helped me to focus on what I wanted to study and ultimately made my college experience more fulfilling. Having a little extra time to figure things out allowed me to prepare to decide what I wanted to study for my chosen career.
1;I was very disappointed when I was hired for a top retailer's training program and was placed in the store management track, when I had my heart set on the buyer track. As it ends up, my strengths in employee engagement, inventory planning, and sales have enabled me to progress rapidly to my assistant store manager position, so the disappointment was a blessing in disguise. 
1;I lost my father to pancreatic cancer and, ever since then, I have spent time volunteering to help raise awareness and funds for cancer research. I volunteer for PanCan, an advocacy group, and I'm part of their volunteer network. One of the things I'm passionate about is helping to find a cure, in whatever way I can. I also love getting to know patients and survivors on a personal level.
1;I'm passionate about painting. I take an evening art class once a week and try to find time each weekend to paint. Painting is a good way for me to relax after a busy week. I also feel that it helps me to be more creative in other aspects of my life. Some of my most creative solutions to work problems have come when I'm painting in the studio.
1;I'm passionate about baking. I love the process of researching new recipes and testing them out. I've been writing up my experiences with baking for the past three years, and every year, I host a massive cookie swap around holiday time with friends. I’m very detail-oriented, and love the scientific aspects of baking. However, I’m also a very social person, and use my baking as a chance to get together with friends and family.
1;My passion is working with students who are struggling academically. I tutor a group of first-graders once a week in reading and writing. I love helping students make connections in subjects they struggle with. 
1;What I look for in a job, and what I love about this customer service representative position, is the ability to utilize my communication and customer service skills. I love interacting with customers and quickly and effectively problem-solving with them. Down the road, after becoming an expert in your product line and developing strong relationships with your customers, I would love to work in sales. 
1;My dream job involves an extensive amount of teamwork, such as regular staff meetings and group projects. I love that this job emphasizes communication among colleagues and between management and staff. My previous job was 50% team projects, and I am excited to continue that kind of teamwork and open communication here.
1;My dream job would allow me to develop web content for a variety of companies. I love getting to know different clients and developing content to suit their unique needs. For example, in my last job, I worked for clients in industries ranging from healthcare to education and received praise for my work with a variety of companies. I love that this job would allow me to work with a range of clients.
1;I’ve never been much of a troublemaker, even as a teenager. I suppose the biggest thing I ever got away with was a college prank I helped organize and arrange. We turned all of the desks upside-down in every classroom. I love to have fun, positive relationships with my colleagues, although I think my pranking days are over!
1;While this is actually a positive thing, the biggest thing I got away with was helping to arrange a surprise vacation for a sick friend. We planned the whole thing without her finding out until we took her to the airport! Of course, I’ve gotten away with a couple of less positive things too – I’m sure I stayed out past curfew a few times without my parents ever finding out!
1;The worst thing I’ve gotten away with in college was sometimes cutting class the week before midterms and final exams. Especially in large, 400-student lecture classes where attendance wasn’t taken, I often found it was a better use of my time to study the class materials independently at home or with a study group in the library rather than sit in the classroom. I generally arranged things with a group of study partners so that one of us would attend the lecture, take good notes, and share them with the rest of the group. We rotated the note-taking responsibility between group members over the course of the term, which allowed us all extra time to cram for the exams.
1;There were times during college – especially towards the end of the year when money was tight – that my friends and I turned dumpster diving into an art form. None of us wanted to explain to our parents (again!) how we’d run short on food money (with me, it was generally because I loved to de-stress by going to out-of-town football games and concerts). So we’d do midnight raids on the upscale grocery store dumpsters and stock up on expired canned food and slightly-wilted veggies. We justified this to ourselves by deciding we were just doing our part to reduce landfill and save the environment. It probably wasn’t the smartest thing to do – but none of us got bitten by a rat or got tetanus or food poisoning.
1;On the job, I would rather be respected. My success as a salesperson has stemmed largely from my ability to anticipate the needs and problems of my customers and to present my products as a way to meet those needs and solve those problems. Once respect has been established, I find that my customers continue to come back to me for additional service. Of course, I want my clients to like me as well, and I do the little things like bringing them a favorite food or taking them for a round of golf so that they also see the personal value of our relationship
1;One of my new clients was concerned about the quantity of packing material that was used in the production process. I brought her to a plant where our equipment was in use and demonstrated how efficiently it utilized resources. I helped her price out the payback schedule if she purchased the new machine, and she was able to write a justification that was approved by her boss. She has called upon me for advice many times since then and continued to purchase our products.
1;I am actually very satisfied with the career I’ve chosen, and how it has progressed. I have learned important things at every stage, and from the people, I have worked with.
1;I have had people ask me in the past if I would have been happier if I had started out in my current career of academia instead of beginning in the business world.
1;I am very glad that I experienced the business world. I think it gives me unique insight and a perspective that I otherwise wouldn’t have. Even though I love what I do now, I wouldn’t change how I got here
1;I'm looking for a bigger challenge and to grow my career, and I didn’t feel like I could give equal attention both to my job search and to my full-time work responsibilities. It didn’t seem ethical to slack off from my former job in order to conduct my job search, and so I left the company.
1;I was laid off from my last position when our department was eliminated due to corporate restructuring.
1;I was lucky enough to land a job at a startup right out of school, which means that I wore many hats right from my first day in the office. Now I’m looking forward to taking my graphic design skills into a senior role.
1;I love helping writers develop. In my current job, I’ve had the opportunity to mentor many experts who had knowledge our readers needed, but not necessarily the writing experience necessary to translate those ideas into print. I’m excited about doing the same thing in a non-profit environment where I can use my skills to give back to my community.
1;I’ve been one of the top sellers at ABC Corp for three quarters running, increasing sales by more than 10% each quarter. But now that I’m in the Los Angeles area, I’m ready to bring my skills to this market. I’ve always dreamed of working at XYZ Inc., and I was excited to see an opening that’s a perfect fit for my experience and abilities.
1;Being cut loose was a blessing in disguise. Now I have an opportunity to explore jobs that better suit my qualifications and interests
1;The job wasn't working out, so my boss and I agreed that it was time for me to move on to a position that would show a better return for both of us. So, I'm available and ready to work.
1;My job was outsourced to India. It was unfortunate, because people familiar with my work say I did my job well and I always got excellent reviews from my managers
1;I was desperate for work and took the wrong job without looking around the corner. I won't make that mistake again. I'd prefer an environment that is congenial, structured, and team-oriented, where my best talents can shine and make a substantial contribution.
1;To be honest, I wasn't considering a change, but a former colleague recommended this job to me. I looked into the position and was intrigued by the role and by the company. What you're offering sounds like an exciting opportunity and an ideal match for my qualifications.
1;I resigned to focus on finding a job that is closer to home and will use my skills and experience in a different capacity.
1;I didn't have room to grow with my previous employer
1;I have been volunteering in this capacity and love this kind of work. I want to turn my passion into the next step of my career.
1;After several years in my last position, I am looking for a company where I can contribute more and grow in a team-oriented environment.
1;I am interested in a new challenge and want to use my skills and experience in a different capacity than in the past
1;I was commuting and spending an hour each day traveling back and forth. I would prefer to be closer to home
1;The position seems to correlate with my skillset. Unfortunately, in my last job, I wasn't able to use my training and experience fully.
1;The company was downsizing and I thought it made sense to find another position before my job was eliminated
1;I took this job right out of college, and the position helped me develop a number of skills necessary for this industry. However, there was little opportunity for growth, and I felt it was time to move on to a job with more responsibility. This job will allow me to use the skills I developed at my last job while taking on challenges that I know I am ready for.
1;I resigned because the schedule was no longer manageable. The position required me to be on-call evenings and weekends, and it was difficult to arrange childcare on short notice. This job will allow me to continue to use my nursing skills in a more ideal schedule.
1;"I resigned because the position was part-time; while I loved the responsibilities I had there, I am ready for a position where I can perform similar duties full-time"
1;"My skills weren't a good match for my previous employer's needs; however, it looks like they'd be a terrific fit for this position"
1;I've been working as a temp in the same industry, and with similar duties to the job here. However, I am now seeking a permanent position, so I resigned from the temp agency's staffing roster. I loved my time as a temp, and look forward to applying the skills I learned to a full-time job.
1;I'm seeking to grow my career with a position in a new, forward-thinking company. It was difficult to job search while working at my previous company, so I am now devoted to finding a position where I can put my skills and abilities to the best use. Your company is the type of organization where I think I can add value
1;"I resigned due to family circumstances; however, I have regained the flexibility I need to work effectively in a full-time job"
1;I worked on several freelance projects, while actively job seeking.
1;I volunteered for a literacy program that assists disadvantaged children.
1;My aging parents needed a temporary caregiver, and I spent time looking after them.
1;I spent time being a stay-at-home mom and volunteering at my daughter's school.
1;I took some continuing education classes and seminars.
1;I spent a year traveling abroad after I graduated from college
1;Based on what you’ve said and from the research I’ve done, your company is looking for an administrative assistant who is both strong in interpersonal skills and in tech skills. I believe my experience aligns and makes me a great fit. I'm an effective communicator who is skilled in giving oral presentations, speaking on the phone, and communicating via email. I'm also fluent in a number of relevant software programs, including content management systems and spreadsheet suites. I’d love to bring my diverse skill set to your company.
1;You describe in the job listing that you're looking for a special education assistant teacher with an abundance of patience and compassion. Having served as a tutor at a summer school for dyslexic children for the past two years, I've developed my ability to be extremely patient while still achieving academic gains with my students. My experience teaching phonics to children aged 6 to 18 has taught me strategies for working with children of all ages and abilities, always with a smile.
1;My experience with technology and, in particular, my ability to maintain and update websites, make me a good match for this position. In my most recent role, I was responsible for maintaining our department web page. This required me to update student and faculty profiles, and post information about upcoming events.
1; In my free time, I learned to code in JavaScript and Swift. I then used my coding skills to revamp our homepage and received praise from our department head and the Dean of Students for my initiative. I would love to bring my coding skills and my general passion for learning new technologies to this position.
1;You've explained that you're looking for a sales executive who is able to effectively manage over a dozen employees. In my 15 years of experience as a sales manager, I've developed strong motivational and team-building skills. I was twice awarded manager-of-the-year for my innovative strategies for motivating employees to meet and surpass quarterly deadlines. If hired, I will apply my leadership abilities and strategies to achieve profit gains in this position.
1;If you're looking for someone to lead meetings, then I'm probably not the right fit for this position. I'm better suited to being an active participant in meetings than to lead them. But where I really shine is execution—so often, a meeting generates a lot of great ideas, but then none of them are completed. One of my strengths is following up on meeting tasks and completing projects in general.
1;You shouldn't hire me if an extrovert wouldn't fit in well at your company or in this job. I thrive on interaction with colleagues and customers. I can stay on task, but building positive relationships with people is my clear priority.
1;"When it comes to projects, I always hit my deadline. But I have to admit; I'm not great at arriving to work at 9 a.m. sharp. If it's important to your company to have employees arrive bright and early, full of energy, then I'm likely not the right match. I'm a classic night owl, which means I tend to work late at the office."
1; I can contribute my ability to streamline office processes. For example, I developed a new method for scheduling client appointments, which led to an 85% decrease in scheduling errors. I would love to apply, not only this method, but also my other organizational skills to this job at your company.
1;I will bring my unique visioning ability to your company. I am experienced in many areas related to this company’s current goals, including expanding international sales. For example, I helped improve international sales at a previous company by over 25%. My sales background and my planning ability will help to facilitate that growth.
1;My previous work experience includes innovation in many areas, including strategies for more effective teamwork. At my previous company, I devised strategies for improving teamwork and communication among members of team projects. I can bring to your organization not only my ideas from my previous job, but my general passion for innovation too.
1;My initial salary was $X, and my final salary was $Y. However, this does not take into account the six bonuses I received while working there.
1;"My initial salary was $X. Over the years, I took on more responsibilities, including managing my own team and running projects; these are the type of responsibilities I know you are hoping your ideal candidate can handle. Due to this increase in responsibility, my final salary was $Y."
1;When I began working at the company as a full-time grant writer, my salary was $X. Over time, that was increased to $Y, in large part due to my successful record of receiving grants. When I became a part-time employee, my salary became $Z. However, I continued to receive annual bonuses and other benefits for my exceptional work
1;I was hired as the marketing director at Company A at the salary of $Y. When I first started working for Company A, I supervised the introduction of a new cleaning product. Sales for the product exceeded expectations during both the first and second year, and I was rewarded with a raise to $Z, promotion to executive director of marketing, and an annual 10% bonus. Shortly thereafter, I started a family with the adoption of my twins, and decided to downshift my career for 3 years. The company convinced me to stay on as a marketing analyst for 3 days a week for the reduced salary of $M.
1;I was making $L working as a communications director for my non-profit employer. I sacrificed pay because of my belief in the mission to support cancer research. In comparing communications director positions in the for profit sector in our region, I noticed that salaries were about 20% higher.
1;My salary range is flexible. I would, of course, like to be compensated fairly for my decade of experience and award-winning sales record. However, I'm open to discussing specific numbers once we've discussed the details of the position.
1;My salary requirements are flexible, but I do have significant experience in the field that I believe adds value to my candidacy. I look forward to discussing in more detail what my responsibilities at this company would be. From there, we can determine a fair salary for the position.
1;I'd like to learn more about the specific duties required of this position, which I look forward to in this interview. However, I do understand that positions similar to this one pay in the range of $X to $Z in our region.
1;I'm open to discussing what you believe to be a fair salary for the position. However, based on my previous salary, my knowledge of the industry, and my understanding of this geographic area, I'd expect a salary in the general range of $X to $Y. Again, I'm open to discussing these numbers with you.
1;"My years of experience have prepared me well for this position. You mentioned that customer service is a big part of this job; I spent three years working in a high-volume call center, answering customer calls, and identifying solutions."
1;I developed extensive skills working with customers even when they were distressed. I'm excellent at deescalating situations and finding a way to make the customer happy. Our customer satisfaction rating rose 10% during my tenure at my previous employer. Since the role of your marketing department is to improve customers' impressions of the company, my experience would be a great asset to your team.
1;I worked as a kennel assistant at a local animal hospital during the summer before my freshman year of college. It was there I discovered what I wanted to do as a career. I decided I would go to college and focus on becoming a small-animal veterinarian, so that's what I did. I have been working at the same animal hospital ever since.
1;Salary is not my top priority. Not that I have a trust fund, but I will work for less money, will take direction from managers of any age, will continue to stay current on technology, and will not leave you in the lurch if Hollywood calls to make me a star. And I don't insist that it's my way or the highway.
1;As you note, I've worked at a higher level, but this position is exactly what I'm looking for. You offer the opportunity to achieve the magic word: balance. I'm scouting for something challenging but a little less intense, so I can spend more time with my family
1;“I have the education and experience to fit in readily with the exceptional team here.
1;My maturity, along with my experience, will enable me to do a terrific job for the company
1;My customers are finding that our apples make an excellent healthy snack for families on the run or to pack with your children's school lunch. Our apples are fresh and crisp since we source them weekly from local orchards. We only sell apples that are grown organically without pesticides and chemical fertilizers. Our apples are loaded with beneficial fiber, vitamins, and nutrients. So, in addition to being sweet and tasty, they are great for your health.
1;I would love to be your preferred provider for the highest quality pens. I will work hard to justify the confidence that you would place in me and our product and make sure you are thoroughly satisfied with the product. Can we move forward with your first order?
1;My degree in American history helped me develop the research skills necessary for a job in library science. For example, for my senior project, I researched historical newspapers at three different libraries, and also conducted extensive online research. My ability to find and read a variety of sources will allow me to help students that approach me with similar questions.
1;I know that a bachelor's degree in English literature may feel very far afield from computer science, but one thing I've discovered while working as an engineer is the importance of communication. Those were skills that got really sharp through my undergrad experience. Then, of course, once I was in the workforce and realized programming was a passion, I attended graduate school in computer science at ABC University to strengthen my technological skills. 
1;In my undergrad history class, we needed to work in groups to present a paper. It involved a lot of collaboration, and our group was chosen randomly, so we didn't have a pre-existing relationship. I quickly realized we needed an organizational leader and assumed that role. I find that often happens in offices too: There are a lot of people with passion and knowledge, but someone needs to direct and organize that energy. Recently, I worked on a project to update the company style guide, and found myself developing the framework for how we would organize the work, solicit feedback, and incorporate ideas. 
1;At my college, it was always very clear which classes to take if your goal was a high GPA. Not only did I opt to take the more challenging classes—which meant sometimes getting lower grades than my peers—but I also participated in the track team, which required devoting many hours to practice, and held a part-time job. I'm proud of my experience in college, but as you can see, the grades are just one portion of what I did. 
1;"I did not pursue a master's degree because I had developed extensive programming skills while pursuing my undergraduate degree, and for this reason I was ready to begin my career in coding as soon as I graduated. For example, by my senior year, I had become fluent in Java, Python, C#, and PHP. Because of my coding knowledge and professionalism, I successfully moved up in the ranks at the first company I worked for after college. However, I continue to seek educational opportunities; for example, I am currently learning Ruby and Objective-C through an online program. "
1;I had a truly wonderful college experience. In general, I just wish I could have done more: taken more classes, participated in more extracurriculars, and attended even more guest speaker events. I got so much out of the experience, and did my best to balance academics with building relationships. 
1;Midway through college, I had a summer internship with a start-up company. During that summer, I got very immersed in the creation of a product that became the focal point for the company's marketing strategy. I was asked to stay on, so deferred going back. I'd imagined it would just be a year, but it wound up turning into a big opportunity, and so I suck with that company, working there for 5 years. It's always on my list to complete the degree, but I've found, so far, that the degree isn't necessary for me to perform in the workplace.
1;Although I'm not familiar with the others who you are interviewing for this position, I'm sure there are a lot of talented people applying for the job. However, given my unique background and experiences, I consider myself to be a strong candidate for this position
1;One of my big challenges will be adjusting to the new workflow and creating a new type of report to present to clients. My plan would be to ask a lot of questions when preparing my first report. I'll also ask a colleague to review the report before sharing it with the client.
1;I've previously used Microsoft Word processing and presentation software exclusively, and haven't used Google's online equivalents. Although I'll have to learn a whole new set of keyboard shortcuts, I'll devote time to reading blog posts that walk me through the differences between the two types of software, and I'll watch online tutorials.
1;I'm excited by the idea of scheduling an offsite conference but it'll definitely be a challenge. On the plus side, although I haven't organized large corporate events before, I have planned personal events, including a 100-person family reunion, and team-wide holiday dinners for 200 people. If I get this job, one of the first things I'll do is meet with the person who organized last year's offsite event to get pointers. I'll also touch base with a former colleague of mine who orchestrated offsite conferences for her company. 
1;In my current role, directing the content strategy for ABC company, I spend most of my time managing my team and setting the big-picture strategy for content. That's all work that I enjoy and find gratifying, but I find that I overwhelmingly miss writing and editing copy. When it comes to content, creating it is my true strength, and I'm eager to have execution (rather than strategy) be the main focus of my days. 
1;As you know, this role represents a bit of a career shift for me. So in many ways, starting out at this level makes a lot of sense—I've had more responsibilities at other positions, but not within this industry. I'm excited to grow my knowledge, while using some of the skills I've gained in previous roles. This is such a good moment for me to make the transition on a personal level, since my kids are all about to graduate college, and financially, having a lower salary is doable. 
1;My expectations for my previous job were that I would be teaching my students a completely new eighth-grade English curriculum that I would have to develop myself, but that I would have the support of a co-teacher in all of my classes. This blend of support and independence allowed me to successfully develop a new curriculum that is still used in the school to this day.
1;In my previous job, my expectation—based on the job description and interview—was that my job would involve working primarily on team-based projects. Ultimately, many more of my projects than expected were ones I developed and completed on my own. While my expectations were not quite met, this independence allowed me to greatly strengthen my skills in all aspects of project development.
1;One expectation I had for my previous job was that I would have the opportunity as an administrative assistant to step into a variety of leadership roles. This expectation was met. For example, I became the supervisor and trainer for all interns and part-time administrative employees. I also attended a number of seminars on leadership and management. I believe my experience and skills as a manager will serve me extremely well as a supervisor at your company
1;I was responsible for hiring in my previous role. I expected that the position would expand to cover employee training and development, and those expectations were met. I was successfully able to coordinate hiring, onboarding new employees, and employee development programs for current staff.
1;On a day-to-day basis, I was the primary point of contact with clients, working to ensure that their needs were met while escalating urgent matters to my supervisors.
1;During a difficult financial period, I was able to satisfactorily negotiate repayment schedules with multiple vendors. I developed a mutually beneficial payment plan and barter program that worked with my company’s revenue flow and project schedule, and the vendor needs at the time. In addition, the agreement was easier for me to obtain because I worked very hard at developing a positive relationship with the vendor in the months that we’d been working together. From this experience, I learned the importance of thinking outside the box while solving a problem. I also learned the importance of developing and maintaining good relationships with vendors.
1;When the software development of our new product stalled, I coordinated the team that managed to get the schedule back on track. We were able to successfully troubleshoot the issues and solve the problems, within a very short period of time, and without completely burning out our team. I was able to do this by motivating the senior engineering team to brainstorm a technologically innovative solution that would solve the customer’s issues with fewer development hours on our end.
1;A long-term client was about to take their business to a competitor. I met with the customer and was able to change how we handled the account on a day-to-day basis, in order to keep the business. From this situation, I learned the importance of being mindful of client relations and operations, not just after issues arise, but for the duration of the relationship. As a result, other account managers have adopted my check-in and management processes, and have also seen improved results with their accounts
1;Our company newsletter was frequently sent late—and worse, sometimes had errors or typos. It was a bad look for the marketing department. I reviewed this newsletter workflow with the team, which revealed several issues: There was no deadline for newsletter submissions and no one person had ownership of the project. Our marketing coordinator had recently requested more responsibility, so I asked her to oversee the process. Together, we created a schedule, a form for submissions, and a review process. Since instituting these changes, the newsletter has gone out precisely on time and error-free—plus, clicks and opens have increased.
1;When I first became an assistant manager of a sales branch, I tried to take on everything myself, from the day-to-day operations of the branch to making all of the big sales calls. I quickly learned that the best managers know how to delegate effectively so that work is done efficiently. Since then, I have won numerous awards for my management skills, and I believe a lot of this has to do with my ability to delegate effectively.
1;I’m the kind of person who tries to learn and grow from every mistake. Years ago, a team I was working on failed to land a sale, and we were told it had to do in part with our ineffective visuals. Over the next six months, I spent much of my free time learning how to use various software programs to create enticing visual presentations. Since then, I’ve been continuously praised for my visuals in meetings and sales pitches.
1;One thing I have learned from past mistakes is when to ask for help. I have learned that it is far better to ask for clarification and solve an issue right away than to be unsure. I know that your company emphasizes teamwork and the need to be in constant communication with one another, and I think my ability to ask (and answer) questions of my peers would help me fit in very well with your company culture.
1;I enjoyed the people I worked with. It was a friendly and fun atmosphere, and I actually enjoyed going to work each morning. I felt that the leadership team was great too. They knew all of their employees on a first name basis and tried to make those personal connections. I also enjoyed the fact that the office tried to do community outreach with local organizations.
1;One of the reasons I’m leaving is that I felt I was not challenged enough at the job. As a new employee in the working world, the company offered me a great opportunity for a good entry-level position—one that I’ll always be grateful for. However, after being there for so many years, I felt I wasn’t able to fulfill all of my potential because of a real lack of challenge. There was no room for advancement in the company. While I did enjoy working there and appreciate the skills I developed, I feel my skill set can be better employed elsewhere. Somewhere my capabilities are more recognized, and where there is the opportunity for growth.
1;Through my experience at ABC Company, I learned a lot about different management styles and strategies for maintaining cooperation in a large group project setting. I feel that as valuable as that experience has been, I am eager to work on more specialized projects on which I will have the opportunity to be more of a leader than was going to be possible there.
1;While the people at XYZ Company were terrific to work with, I felt that the opportunities for me there were limited by the structure and size of the company. I believe that a larger company with an international presence can offer challenges and opportunities unavailable at a smaller firm. The position with your company is a great match for my skill set, and I feel that I would be an asset to your marketing (or HR or IT) department.
1;One of my greatest successes at my current job has been leading the installation and implementation of a new software program in the office. As office manager, I quickly learned the software program before it was installed, and then led a seminar to instruct all employees how to use it. Within five days, everyone felt comfortable and confident using it. My employers said this was the smoothest technological transition we have ever had at work. I know I can bring this technical knowledge and leadership ability to your office as well.
1;Last year, I made revisions to my school’s sixth-grade curriculum, particularly to the literacy curriculum. At the end of the year, we saw a 20% improvement in students’ literacy test scores. My ability to achieve success among students is part of why I love curriculum development.
1;When I first began my job over five years ago, I struggled to meet a deadline for a multi-part project. After that, I developed a new strategy for managing my time. After implementing this new strategy, I have been on time or ahead of time for every project, both individual and team projects. I think this ability to keep a group on task will make me a strong team leader in your office.
1;A cash register once broke when I had a long line of customers ahead of me. I thought I was going to have a big problem on my hands. Instead, I kept my cool and reorganized the line of customers so they went to different employees, while I quickly fixed the register. My ability to think on my feet and not become overwhelmed by stress has helped me win multiple Employee of the Month awards.
1;As you can see from my resume, I currently work as a production manager for a meat packing plant. I discovered shortly after taking on the job that there were several hand injuries from one of the packing machines. I learned from Human Resources that six workers in the past two years had received medical attention or missed work time when stationed in that area of the assembly line. HR staff had interviewed the workers in question and believed that fatigue was a contributing factor.
1;I decided to decrease the amount of time between five-minute breaks from 90 minutes to 45 minutes, placed a safety reminder sign in easy view, and personally reminded the workers stationed in that area before each shift about the need for optimal concentration.
1;During the next year, there was only one incident of worker injury in that area. I also researched an alternative machine that would perform the same function with less risk, and upper management is currently considering my proposal.
1;Once I found a major flaw in the work of one of the most senior members of the department, which could have been very costly to the company if it had been overlooked. I went directly to them and called it to their attention so they could fix it before it affected the final outcome.
1;I feel that the best way to deal with any challenges is to meet them head-on. When I found that one of my colleagues was saying things that weren't true behind my back, I went to them and talked it through. It turned out they had misunderstood what I had said, and I was able to set the record straight with them, and my supervisor.
1;One of the major problems I have found in this profession has been a lack of proper funding for the programs we are trying to implement. I think I have a lot of creative ideas to help overcome some of the budget limitations inherent in this type of work.
1;There's no ongoing criticism. I'm open to personal and professional growth and welcome the opportunity to improve.
1;One of the things that I am sometimes criticized for is being too much of a perfectionist. I tend to expect very high standards of work from myself
1;I had a supervisor many years ago tell me that I was too critical of other people’s work. I took that to heart and made sure from that point forward that my analysis and suggestions were always supportive and helpful rather than critical. More recently, people have praised my ability to give thoughtful and useful feedback.
1;From the time I was a child, I always had a hard time delivering presentations in a group situation. A few years ago, I took several courses in public speaking, and last year I received an award for a presentation I gave at the company’s yearly executive board meeting.
1;I’ve never been much of a troublemaker, even as a teenager. I suppose the biggest thing I ever got away with was a college prank I helped organize and arrange. We turned all of the desks upside-down in every classroom. I love to have fun, positive relationships with my colleagues, although I think my pranking days are over!
1;While this is actually a positive thing, the biggest thing I got away with was helping to arrange a surprise vacation for a sick friend. We planned the whole thing without her finding out until we took her to the airport! Of course, I’ve gotten away with a couple of less positive things too – I’m sure I stayed out past curfew a few times without my parents ever finding out!
1;The worst thing I’ve gotten away with in college was sometimes cutting class the week before midterms and final exams. Especially in large, 400-student lecture classes where attendance wasn’t taken, I often found it was a better use of my time to study the class materials independently at home or with a study group in the library rather than sit in the classroom. I generally arranged things with a group of study partners so that one of us would attend the lecture, take good notes, and share them with the rest of the group. We rotated the note-taking responsibility between group members over the course of the term, which allowed us all extra time to cram for the exams
1;There were times during college – especially towards the end of the year when money was tight – that my friends and I turned dumpster diving into an art form. None of us wanted to explain to our parents (again!) how we’d run short on food money (with me, it was generally because I loved to de-stress by going to out-of-town football games and concerts). So we’d do midnight raids on the upscale grocery store dumpsters and stock up on expired canned food and slightly-wilted veggies. We justified this to ourselves by deciding we were just doing our part to reduce landfill and save the environment. It probably wasn’t the smartest thing to do – but none of us got bitten by a rat or got tetanus or food poisoning.
1;When I'm on a tight deadline and working to finish a project, I get frustrated if I run into roadblocks, like if my internet won't load or my partner is slacking off.
1;In my last job at ABC company, there was one time when I had a run of frustrated customers on the phone, who were quite rude. It was hard not letting that rub off on me, but after the fifth call, I took a one-minute break to walk around the block and remind myself that the customers didn't mean to make things personal.
1;In general, I'm a fairly even-keeled person. Of course there are times when things do not go according to plan, or when it feels like someone is not pulling their weight, but I try to head off these situations by forming contingency plans and keeping the lines of communication open with my team. When I do feel fired up, I usually try to take a moment away. 
1; try to look at every situation from an analytical perspective, and not let my emotions dictate my actions. I have had employees in the past whose professionalism has been questionable, and who have not met the requirements of the job. In those situations, I have found that the best policy is to be honest about the issues and offer clear strategies for improvement.
1;"I don’t think anger is an appropriate workplace emotion. I have dealt with situations that I found frustrating; for example, I had a coworker who was very confrontational in her written and oral communication. I felt like I was constantly being criticized for things beyond my control. I sat down with her and talked about ways that we could improve our communication. After having that calm, productive conversation, our relationship as co-workers improved greatly, and we actually became collaborators on a number of successful projects."
1;Anger to me means loss of control. I don't lose control. When I get stressed, I step back, take a deep breath, thoughtfully think through the situation and then begin to formulate a plan of action. For instance, when I am given multiple projects to complete in a short amount of time, I come up with a strategy for how to complete the work in a steady, methodical manner that will not overwhelm me
1;"When I was working on a major project with a team, I got frustrated when one team member failed to deliver an asset on schedule, after promising it would be ready. I took a moment to walk around the block, then invited the team member out for coffee to talk about what happened and how I could help. My approach focused on ""how can we fix this in the future"" rather than on the many ways the co-worker messed up. I was glad I took the time to chill out since it turned out my co-worker was dealing with serious personal health issues and unforgiving deadlines from several other projects. "
1;At Company XYZ where I'm working, there's a requirement for people in the managerial level to have a graduate degree, regardless of other qualifications. At Company ABC, I managed a small team of three people, and I've continued to sharpen my managerial skills in the projects that I lead at XYZ. So I feel prepared for this next level.
1;That's a great question. Last year, a role opened up and I applied for it, but the company ultimately hired someone from outside. When I asked for feedback from interviewers, they told me they thought the role called for someone with a higher level of database experience. Since then, I took a class and earned a certification
1;Well, that's one of the reasons I'm looking for new opportunities. Company ABC is a small company, and the organizational structure is flat. That’s been beneficial for me as an employee, since I was able to learn a lot and expand my responsibilities beyond the formal definition of my role. But now, I'm ready to work at role XYZ, and after discussions with the company CEO, it's clear that I'll have to work elsewhere in order to hit that career milestone.
0;He shows himself to be a person who does not want to work with others.
1;My colleagues would say that I am very optimistic, as I see setbacks as opportunities to learn and grow. There is always a creative solution to a problem, and I love searching for it. One instance that comes to mind was when colleagues from my last job were upset about budget cuts to our department, and I devised a few clever ways to maintain some of our resources on a shoestring budget. They ended up being implemented
1;I’ve been told that I am both a strong leader and a team player. In fact, one colleague offered to write me a personal letter of reference at one point because of my strong team leadership. He was impressed by my ability to effectively lead a group of colleagues while also listening to and considering everyone’s input as we determined the best plan of action for this new company initiative
1;I can be flexible when it comes to my work environment. From your website, it looks like the environment in the engineering department here at RRS is fast-paced and structured to expand production. I enjoy working in an area experiencing rapid growth, and I think this kind of environment is conducive to new ideas and applications
1;I have worked in many types of environments and enjoyed learning new things from each. I would say that while I don’t prefer a particular environment, I really like working with people who are committed to getting things done and who are passionate about their work
1;I enjoy working in an environment where the members of the team have a strong sense of camaraderie and a good work ethic. I like working with competent, kind, funny people who like to get things done. It’s important to me to feel that I can trust my team members to always do their best because I do
1;I define success in different ways. At work, it is meeting the goals set by my supervisors and my fellow workers. It is my understanding, from talking to a few of your other employees, that the GGR company is recognized not only for rewarding success but also for giving employees opportunities to grow. After work, I enjoy playing softball, so success on the field is catching a pop fly to win the game
1;For me, success is about doing my job well. I want to be recognized as someone who always does her best and tries her hardest to achieve her goals
1;I evaluate success based not only on my work but also on the work of my team. In order for me to be considered successful, the team needs to achieve both our individual and our team goals
1;I tend to view success incrementally. As someone who is invigorated by new, complex challenges, I never want to find myself in a situation where I feel as if there is nothing left to learn or achieve. If, over the course of my employment, I can leave work each evening satisfied that I’ve learned something new or useful, this counts as success to me
1;Success, for me, will always be about making a difference in other people’s lives. If I know that at the end of the day my work has helped someone find a job or feed their family or turn their life around, then I sleep well at night and wake up eager to start work all over again the next day.
1;Decisions I have to make within a team are difficult, only because these decisions take more time and require deliberate communication between team members. For example, I was working on a team project, and my colleagues and I had to make a number of choices about how to use our limited budget. Because these decisions involved group conversations, our team learned how to communicate effectively with one another, and I believe we ultimately made the best decisions for the team
1;As a manager, the most difficult decisions I make involve layoffs. Before making those tough decisions, I always think carefully about what is best for the business and my employees. While I don’t relish making those kinds of choices, I don’t shy away from this part of my job. A few years ago, I had to let some employees go due to the economic climate. It was a hard decision that was ultimately necessary for the good of the company and everyone working for the organization
1;I find that the hardest decision I have to make is when I have to choose between strong team members for a promotion. There have been occasions when, even though I liked one person better than another, I nonetheless had to choose the other person based on their potential to assume the responsibilities of their new role. Sometimes I also had to promote younger employees over staff with seniority, simply because they were more skilled in the use of technology and more willing to work overtime. It’s never easy, but ultimately you have to think about who will be the most effective and productive in the new position.
1;When I was working on a software implementation team at ABC Company, we took over another company and had to transition many clients to a new product in a short amount of time. It took a lot of planning, time, hard work, and effort, but we were able to complete the project in a timely manner.
1;When Judy was on maternity leave, I took over servicing her clients as well as my own. It was a good challenge to ensure they got the same amount of attention from our company as when both of us were on the job. At times when we had increased demands, I brought in George from accounting to assist in calls and tasks to ensure everyone got good service
1;'ve learned from each boss I've had. From the good ones, what to do, and from the challenging ones, what not to do.
1;My best boss was a manager who enabled me to take on more responsibility as I progressed in my job. I've had other bosses with a more hands-off management style, but I appreciated the interaction with the first manager I mentioned.
1;My best boss was a woman who showed me the importance of suggestive selling. She was able to show a customer the perfect accessories to go with an outfitwithout being pushy, and taught me to increase my selling abilities tremendously.
1;My worst boss was a man who provided very little feedback about my performance. I was able to improve communication by providing unsolicited weekly status reports on my projects. Eventually, he furnished some feedback and constructive criticism to these reports and I knew better where I stood.
1;My ideal boss would encourage clear communication between herself and her employees. I believe that communication—in person, as well as via phone and email—is critical to a successful relationship between an employer and employee.
1;I've worked under employers with a variety of management styles. I've had some employers who encourage lots of independent work, and others who prefer to give clear, specific instructions. I thrive in both environments. I work very well independently, but also know when to ask questions.
1;I value an employer who communicates clearly with his employees. I'm a strong written and oral communicator and I appreciate employers who value those skills. In the past, I have had some employers who have been less than clear in conveying their ideas and directions
1;A few rare times in the past, I have spoken to a former supervisor about a particular error. Recently, my boss assigned our team a project. I knew the data he gave us was a couple of years old, and that there was more current data. Working with the most up-to-date information was vital to the success of the project. I went into my boss’s office and spoke to him privately about the error, merely showing him the most recent data. He thanked me and immediately updated the information. We completed the project with great success.
1;I have spoken to a boss about an error, but only when I thought the error would negatively impact the company. For example, a former boss instituted a new online storage system and was unaware that the system was not easily accessible on employee computers. During her daily “open office hours,” I privately discussed the issue with my boss and pointed out the effect these problems had on our ability to complete assigned tasks. She was so glad I brought the issue to her attention that she put me in charge of a task force that solved the error, resulting in increased productivity for all employees.
1;In my last job, I liked the fact that management did not show favoritism and they were understanding of employees’ needs, as well as their strengths. Of course, these things take time to perceive, but I would want my supervisor to try to know me in that way.
1;I would like to be able to go to my manager if I have an issue or idea and to be able to feel comfortable in expressing my thoughts. I would also expect my supervisor to be open and honest with me and to let me know if there is anything I could improve upon or do differently in my work.
1;I really appreciate managers who can give constructive criticism without making employees feel like they have failed or are being negatively judged. Everyone makes mistakes occasionally. When this happens, the best thing to do is to assess and learn from the mistake to avoid repeating it, without belittlement or censure.
1;I believe that the best supervisors convey their expectations in a timely fashion, as well as keeping their teams “in the loop” regarding new changes in the workplace. Although I feel I work very well independently, I also like to touch base regularly with my supervisor to ensure that our projects are all on track – either informally through emails or at formal weekly staff meetings.
1;I have been fortunate to have terrific managers during my career thus far. I have respected each of them and got along well with all of them.
1;No, I am a hard worker, and my managers always seem to appreciate the job I'm doing. I got along well with every manager I've had.
1;I had a rocky start with a manager earlier in my career because we had different expectations for the flow of the workday. Once we talked about it, we realized that our goals were very compatible, and we were able to work successfully together for several years.
1;I once had a manager who brought her problems to work with her on a daily basis. She was going through a difficult time in her personal life, and this tended to affect the atmosphere in the office. It didn't impact my work because I was able to sympathize with her circumstances, but the situation was challenging.
1;I have found that if I take the time to speak with my manager at the beginning of a project, we can all get off to a great start and end up on the same page.
1;I did have an experience where I thought my new supervisor was unhappy with me, so I made a point to arrive early one day so that I could talk to her in private. It turned out that she was not unhappy with me at all, and she apologized that she had come across that way.
1;Given the conservative nature of the industry, the organization was very careful about implementing changes. I understood the nature of their concerns but was somewhat frustrated by the pace of change. I continued to work in a cooperative manner and continued to suggest improvement to the system—some of which were instituted. In the end, my supervisor and others viewed me as a team player and valued my interest in enacting positive changes within the framework of the company.
1;At my previous job, I had an employee who was consistently late when competing tasks, which slowed down the entire department. I spoke to her in private and gave her a warning, including a deadline for improvement. When I saw no improvement, I spoke to Jane again and let her know that I would be reporting her to Human Resources. I also gave her another deadline for improvement. This was the employee’s final deadline. Happily, after a three-week period, she was completing her tasks in a timely fashion. Not only was the problem solved, but her increased productivity helped the department complete projects ahead of schedule.
1;A year ago, I had an employee who struggled with the customer service component of his job. He consistently received low marks from customers for his inability to listen empathetically to their concerns. I had a one-on-one conversation with the employee in which he and I looked over his customer evaluations. By looking at his negative evaluations, the employee was able to identify the problem on his own. I required him to attend a customer service re-training workshop, and I provided one-on-one feedback on his customer service calls for a week. After the conversation, retraining, and personal feedback, his customer evaluation scores improved greatly. He is now receiving regular high marks on his customer feedback forms.
1;I was the manager of an after-school program for K-12 children, and I had a new employee who struggled from her first day. Her co-teachers said that she had low energy in the classroom, and she seemed unhappy to be there. I sat down with her and our Human Resources representative. We had a conversation about how her first couple of weeks had been, and she explained that she was struggling to engage with her class of older students. After a long conversation, we realized that she was much more interested in working with our younger students. We shifted her to a position working in the after-school class for kindergarten students, and she flourished. She received top marks from her students and co-teachers.
1;You can also provide an example of a previous environment you worked in that was similar to the one for which you are applying. Be sure to explain how successful you were in that previous environment.
1;In my last position, I was part of a software implementation team. We all worked together to plan and manage the implementation schedule, to provide customer training, and to ensure a smooth transition for our customers. Our team always completed our projects ahead of schedule with very positive reviews from our clients. Our ability to communicate effectively was what made us such a good team. People expressed concerns clearly and openly, so we resolved issues as soon as they arose.
1;I was part of a team responsible for evaluating and selecting a new vendor for our office equipment and supplies. The inter-departmental team reviewed options, compared pricing and service, and chose a vendor. We once had to implement the transition to a new vendor, which was difficult because each team member suggested a different vendor. However, we held a brief meeting where each member made a pitch for his or her suggested vendor. Everyone thoughtfully listened, and we ultimately voted on a vendor. That vendor has now been working successfully with the company for years.
1;At my current position, I'm part of the team that coordinates the company's lunch-and-learn sessions. Each week, we meet to brainstorm who will be our upcoming guest speaker. We all work together to ensure a diverse mix of speakers, aiming to appeal to a wide swath of people in the company. Because everyone on the team comes from different areas within the company, we've all learned so much about big ideas, from marketing to tech.
1;"As part of a software development team with tight project schedules, there were always fires that needed to be put out. Perhaps the greatest challenge we faced together as a team was when our project lead was suddenly hospitalized, ten days before our final rollout. Even in her absence, we overcame this challenge by working overtime and making an extra effort to ensure that all team members were ""in the loop"" regarding daily project statuses. The release went off without a hitch."
1;I have had many experiences working with a team as a member of my high school athletic program. As a member of my sports team, I understand what it means to be a part of something bigger than myself. Team sports have taught me how to work with a group to accomplish a shared goal.
1;I’ve participated on sports teams since I played T-ball as a kid: I played softball and baseball in high school and on an extracurricular team in college, and I play on a local softball team here. This has really helped me in my professional life, since I know how to evaluate the individual strengths of my associates, communicate well with them, and coordinate my efforts to support theirs.
1;I prefer to work as a team member, because I believe that the best ideas are developed in partnership with others. I’m equally comfortable being a team member and a team lead – a few months ago I was selected to lead our team in a deadline-critical implementation project. Because of our great teamwork, we were able to produce our deliverables to the client well before deadline.
1;I’m a “people person” – I enjoy working with others, and I know how to communicate well, actively listen to my associates’ opinions, and mediate any conflicts that arise. As an extrovert, I’m really energized by team dynamics and excited as I witness the progress we make towards our goals.
1;I can honestly say that I’m comfortable both in working independently as well as in contributing to teams, and I was lucky enough in my previous job to be able to do some of both. Especially at the beginning of projects, I appreciate being able to strategize approaches with team members. Once we have our plan of action established, though, I enjoy working independently on my assigned tasks.  
1;Good teamwork is an essential part of working back-of-house in a restaurant. Although I am primarily a sous chef, I realize that at any point I may be called upon to cover other responsibilities – be it stepping up when the head chef is absent, expediting orders, or even washing dishes when we’re understaffed. I also know how important it is to keep up team morale. A year ago we had several new hires who weren’t getting along. I initiated a monthly team-based cooking competition, with prizes, that motivated them to work together and provided them with a fun creative outlet.  
1;While I’m happy being a strong team player, I also love being able sometimes to take the lead and coordinate everyone’s efforts. I have great organizational, scheduling, and follow-up skills, which is why my supervisor and other team members often call upon me to take the lead in important projects, such as our major new mobile technology system acquisition last year.
1;Not really. Sometimes I’ve had a new manager or team member who struggled slightly to adjust to our team dynamics and organizational culture, but I’ve found that talking to them privately and taking advantage of informal opportunities to connect them with our different team members has always eased those transitions.
1;Most people, even when they love their job, want to be noticed and appreciated for the work they do. I make it a point to recognize my team members’ contributions both privately, with informal “thank you” emails, and publicly during weekly staff meetings.
1;I’m fortunate in having both the energy and the flexibility to work overtime or on weekends when staffing issues arise. My last manager really encouraged our team members to take care of one another, and sometimes that involved covering for others during unexpected absences. I was always happy to step in to help, knowing that my associates would do the same for me.
1;"I would first talk to them privately in a non-confrontational manner, using “I” statements to suggest that there might be a problem that we should resolve together. I’d also do my best to determine the root of the issue and to see if I or other team members could improve this person’s productivity. This approach works for me about 95% of the time; in cases where it doesn’t, I ask for a private consultation with my supervisor to brainstorm other solutions."
1;Absolutely. I’ve had opportunities to work both independently and on teams in the past, and I feel like I’m effective in both settings, so long as lines of communication remain open.
1;I am excited that your company has introduced three new products this past year which have gained traction and garnered increased market share. My current company is in a more stable phase. It produces well-known and respected brands, but has not opened up new markets.
1;I'm extremely interested in the Human Resources Manager job. As you mentioned in the job listing, I'd be responsible for recruiting, orientation, and training. I was responsible for all three of these functions in my most recent position. As Human Resources Assistant Manager at XYZ Company, I recruited over 100 employees and led training for all new staff members in a department of 45 people. I'm interested in this job because it would allow me to use my previous experience while continuing to develop my expertise in new areas of responsibility.
1;I'm interested in this job as a programmer because I'm extremely interested in, and skilled at, learning and excelling at new technologies. I've mastered programs and languages ranging from Python to Java, and I look forward to mastering more programs as they're developed. I'm also interested in creative problem solving, a skill I developed when working as an analyst for the past ten years.
1;I'm interested in this job as a special education teacher because I value your school’s mission, which is to focus on the unique needs of the individual child. As a special education teacher for the past six years, I've developed strategies for achieving academic and personal success for children, and I look forward to bringing these strategies to your school. For example, I developed a system for staying in regular contact with the parents of my students so that I could problem-solve issues with them. I would like to bring this kind of communication tool to your school. 
1;Volunteerism has always been an important part of my life – an example set for me by my parents. When I was researching potential employers, I was impressed by your company’s longstanding dedication to community service. It was exciting for me to learn that your personnel can use up to 7 days of paid time to volunteer, and I also loved learning how everyone pulls together once a year to sponsor a charity golf tournament. It would be great to know I was working for an organization that actively gives back to our community!
1;I went to school with Jane Lewis, who you hired two years ago as part of your software development team. We’ve kept in touch, and she can’t speak highly enough about your company culture and the support that management provides to team members. She praises ATech’s dedication to helping its employees maintain a sane work / life balance – as do your other employees, obviously, since you won the 2018 award as a “Top 10 best software company workplace.” Jane’s enthusiasm is one reason why I’m so very excited about the possibility of being able to work for you.
1;I want this job because it emphasizes sales and marketing, two of my greatest skill sets. In my previous job, I increased sales by 15 percent in what was at the time considered a flat industry. I know I could bring my ten years of sales and marketing experience to this company, and help you continue your years of growth.
1;I understand that this is a company on the rise. As I’ve read on your website and in various press releases, you’re planning to launch several new products in the coming months. I want to be a part of this business as it grows, and I know my experience in product development would help your company as you roll out these products.
1;I have worked as a dental hygienist in a children’s dental office for the past six years. Not only am I experienced working with kids, but I also greatly enjoy it. Being able to work for your office, which caters to children and young adults, would allow me to continue to put my skills to use with a population I love. This is the kind of work environment I would look forward to coming to every day.
1;This job is a good fit for what I've been doing and enjoying throughout my career. It offers a mix of short-term projects and long-term goals. My organizational skills allow me to successfully multitask and complete both kinds of projects.
1;I want this retail job at your store because I know I would be terrific at it. I love engaging with people and providing them with assistance. I also have two years of experience working cash registers at other stores. I am a regular customer of this store, so I would love to apply my skills to a store I believe in and support.
1;I have admired this company’s successful strategies and mission for years. Your emphasis on creating a relationship between your company and the surrounding community have brought you success everywhere you have opened an office. There are values I greatly admire.
1;This company is internationally known for its healthcare products and my experience in the marketing of healthcare products has me intrigued by the opportunity this position presents.
1;Your business is known for making a commitment to bettering the community. I would love the opportunity to use my 10 years of experience in advertising to better this community along with you.
1;Not only are you a leader in the industry, with strong financials and a great business model, but I've also seen on your Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts that users of your product are hugely enthusiastic. In fact, I'm a product user myself and am eager to be a part of the product's development and distribution.
1;Your company's reputation is stellar. Former colleagues of mine work here, and I've seen how much they value the company's willingness to let employees pitch big ideas and have an active leadership role in new initiatives.
1;I know that your company is currently working to expand its international market. Having worked in global sales for the past five years, I am sure that I can help this company achieve its goals.
1;I understand that you’re hoping to grow the sales team by X percent. In my previous job, I added Y sellers and we achieved Z percent growth in the first quarter. I really enjoyed the challenge and I’d love to do the same for your company.
1;I'll reach out to all the colleagues in my department and intersecting departments to learn as much as possible about the roles that everyone plays within the operation. I will devour all the information you've provided on policies and procedures, and during the evening, I'll continue reading everything I can find about the company and industry to get an accurate fix on the state of the firm within the marketplace. Our professional association offers some online tutorials as well, so I will work on those during my off hours.
1;I know you mentioned you would want to teach me the company's internal database system. Like I did during my first week at my previous job, I plan to spend my first few days and evenings learning the database so that I can begin using it fluently as quickly as possible.
1;You have emphasized the importance of writing compelling press releases, and, based on my experience in the governor's office, I should be able to jump in and take on that responsibility quickly.
1;Over the course of the first week, I will compile a list of questions that can't be answered through printed resources or conversations with colleagues...and address them with my supervisor when we meet.
1;I am a list person, so I like to write down objectives for learning to stay on track. For example, you mentioned how important the online purchasing system is to this job, so I would include the goal of mastering that system during the first two weeks at the top of my list.
1;I’m very willing to travel. I have worked as a sales representative in the past, and that work required 50% travel time. I know this job requires 25% travel time, and I’m willing and able to travel when needed for this company.
1;I would define customer service as helping customers handle issues, helping them find the product they want, and doing your best to have them leave the store pleased.
1;I find great satisfaction in being able to find the perfect outfit for a customer, and have them leave the store knowing that they look their best. I'm a big fan of the clothing sold at Company XYZ, and in particular how it's designed to fit people of all sizes. 
1;In an ideal world, that wouldn't ever happen! Of course, we all get stumped sometimes. In those situations, I double-check my work, then loop in colleagues or my manager for more help. I remember once when a customer called inquiring how to delete a program, which sounds simple, but following the standard instructions did not work. I let him know this was an unusual situation and apologized for the delay in coming up with a fix. I double-checked the manual, confirmed that I was following the instructions, then reached out to a colleague who was more knowledgeable about these types of issues. Together, we were able to solve the problem, and then update the training manual to share our new insight.
1;Under the terms of my contract, I’m obligated to give three weeks’ notice. However, I can start the next day, as soon as I’ve met that requirement. I’m eager to meet the rest of the team and get to work.
1;I'm looking for a position where I can have the opportunity to use my written communication skills. As a marketing assistant at your company, I would be able to apply my years of experience as a successful grant writer and would be able to write the kinds of materials I most enjoy working on.
1;I am hoping for a job that will allow me the chance to boost sales at an already successful company, such as your own. I am looking for the opportunity to use the skills that I have developed during my years in marketing to engage your sales force and increase productivity and international sales.
1;I am excited by the opportunity to work with an innovative, successful company such as your own. I look forward to utilizing the experience I have in technology to help streamline a company’s products for even more successful implementation.
1;In my next job, I would like to be able to have a positive impact on my patients and to be able to help them lead a more functional and healthier lifestyle. Your facility offers patients a total recovery program, and I feel that my experience, education, and specialization would make this a good fit for me.
1;I look forward to working for a company whose mission I firmly believe in, such as your own. I look for jobs about which I am passionate because this allows me to be extremely productive and creative.
1;I’m eager to continue developing my clinical skills as a member of this unit. I’ve also noticed that many nurse managers at City Hospital move from staff nurse to nurse manager, and that’s something that interests me as part of my five-year plan. 
1;Within five years, I would like to be recognized as an expert in terms of product knowledge, have developed very close relationships with clients, have significantly expanded the client base in my region, and perhaps have been assigned some major national clients.
1;I plan on gaining additional skills by taking related classes and continuing my involvement with a variety of professional associations. I noticed that your company provides in-house training for employees, and I would certainly be interested in taking relevant classes.
1;I will continue my professional development by participating in conferences, attending seminars, and continuing my education.
1;Over the next five years, I want to gain a deeper understanding of the stock market and build a list of clients, and within the next decade, I want to start my own investment firm. However, first I want to gain experience as an account manager with a large company like yours.
1;Volunteerism has always been an important part of my life – an example set for me by my parents. When I was researching potential employers, I was impressed by your company’s longstanding dedication to community service. It was exciting for me to learn th
1;After graduating in the top 15% of my class, my summer internship in marketing gave me solid experience from which to look for my first full-time position. I look forward to working as a marketing assistant to develop my skills in the industry and advance internally from my role over the next several years.
