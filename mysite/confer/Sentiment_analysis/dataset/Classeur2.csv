1;"I set a goal to be on the dean's list every semester in college and was very disappointed when I missed the mark during the first semester of my junior year. I was working 25 hours a week and took 21 credits that semester. I reduced my work hours to 15 and took 18 credits the next semester and achieved highest honors.

At the time, not being able to go straight to college out of high school was the greatest disappointment. However, the two years I spent working helped me to focus on what I wanted to study and ultimately made my college experience more fulfilling. Having a little extra time to figure things out allowed me to prepare to decide what I wanted to study for my chosen career.";true
